    "1) What is Spark ?\n",
    "        - Apache Spark is a high performance distributed computing \n",
    "          framework which enables you to process Big Data, whith high-\n",
    "          level and easy-to-use APIs.\n",
    "          \n",
    "        - High performance is Spark calling card.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Many companies still rely on MapReduce to process their \n",
    "          workloads, but a lot of them are migrating their applications\n",
    "          to Spark\n",
    "          \n",
    "        - Hadoop and Spark are not alternatibe to each other, Hadoop, \n",
    "          with its HDFS storage system, is uniquely qualified to run\n",
    "          Spark jobs, although you can run Spark on other computing\n",
    "          frameworks, such as Mesos.\n",
    "          \n",
    "        - By running Spark and Hadoop, you can use the same Hadoop\n",
    "          cluster and same data for running both MapReduce and Spark\n",
    "          jobs.\n",

    "3) Pyspark API\n",
    "    Pyspark is Spark's Python API. Pyspark allows Spark applications\n",
    "    to be created from interactive shell or from Python programs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Before executing any code within Spark, the application must create\n",
    "    a SparkContext object. The SparkContext object tells Spark how and\n",
    "    access a cluster.\n",
    "    - SparkContext is a class (with a Constructor) \n",
    "    - For this class we have to create an object (Instancier un objet)\n",
    "    - To the object we can import all the method from the class\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The master property is a cluster URL that determines where the Spark\n",
    "    application will run.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To execute self-contained applications, they must be submitted to the\n",
    "    spark-submit script as :\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "1) Spark RDD\n",
    "    Resilient Distributed Dataset(RDD) is Spark data model/collection\n",
    "    which can be stored in-memory(RAM) and allowes different types of\n",
    "    operations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    RDD will be stored in memory(RAM) which eliminates the for \n",
    "    continuous Input/Output of data from Disk. \n",
    "        And this is the primary difference between Spark and the \n",
    "    MapReduce model use to read and process batch data in Hadoop, here\n",
    "    the data are stored on disk (HDFS).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    It uses in-memory primitives (basics data types) to enable programs \n",
    "    to run up to 100*faster than Hadoop MapReduce applications.\n",
    "    --> This why it's call a high performance framework.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    RDDs are imutable(Read-only) which can be stored in memory as well\n",
    "    as on Hadoop cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "2) RDD Operations\n",
    "    RDD has two basics operations\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Transformation\n",
    "        Creating new RDD from the existing one by applying some changes\n",
    "        such as map, collect, etc. In sum transformation are those \n",
    "        operations that will repealtly done on RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Action \n",
    "        An action is the last operation which will be performed on RDD\n",
    "        and provide the last and final result.\n",
    "            The actual computation in Spark, last or final result such as\n",
    "        reduce, collect, etc.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Spark applications consist of a driver program that controls\n",
    "        the execution of parallel operations across a cluster.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        The action operation is to return all computations from the \n",
    "        cluster to the driver to produce a single result in actual Data\n",
    "        types away from the RDD abstraction of Spark.\n",
    "figure \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "3) Python lambda function\n",
    "        Lambda functions are anonymous functions that are created at \n",
    "        runtime. They can be used wherever function object are required\n",
    "        and are syntactically restricted to a single expression.\n",
    "        - It is call anonymous because it has no name.\n",
    "        - Take arguments (can have many )\n",
    "        - expression(only one expresion)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Syntax \n",
    "        lamdba arguments: expression()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Example\n",
    "        s=lambda x,y : x+y\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "4) Basic Operations on words\n",
    "        First create RDD\n",
    "- Transformation\n",
    "    - Map(): Returns new rdd by applying some operation on each element \n",
    "    - Filter(): Returns new rdd based on condition\n",
    "    - Distinct() :\n",
    "    - FlatMap():\n",
    "    -\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Action \n",
    "    - Count(): Counts the number of elements of new rdd\n",
    "    - Collect(): Returns all elements into an array\n",
    "    - Take(): Returns a subset of first elements\n",
    "    - Foreach(): Applies a function to all element of rdd\n",

Et pour apprendre ces modèles il faut des données, beaucoup de données. Plus il y a de paramètres dans le modèle, plus il faut de données pour réaliser son apprentissage.

      "and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted;\n",
      "moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life\n",
      "and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save\n",
      "his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating\n",

      "of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them. \n",

      "So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely\n",

      "enjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house\n",
      "of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that\n",

      "Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he\n",
      "knew it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him\n",
      "not to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure\n",
      "to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury\n",
      "told him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he\n",
      "has paid for everything in full.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served\n",
      "Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did;\n",

      "covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess\n",
      "lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom\n",
      "of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth\n",
      "asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses,\n",

      "wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her,\n",
      "and down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith\n",
      "she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as\n",
      "a visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear\n",
      "in her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of\n",
      "the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in\n",
      "front of the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to\n",
      "wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some\n",

      "and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among\n",
      "them, he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for\n",
      "he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance.\n",
      "He took her right hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear.\n",
      "\"Welcome,\" said he, \"to our house, and when you have partaken of food\n",
      "you shall tell us what you have come for.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were\n",
      "within he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a\n",
      "strong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy\n",
      "father, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which\n",
      "he threw a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,\n",
      "and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors,\n",
      "that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence,\n",
      "and that he might ask her more freely about his father. \n",
      "\n",
      "A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer\n",
      "and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and\n",
      "she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them\n",
      "bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the\n",
      "house, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set\n",
      "cups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and\n",
      "poured it out for them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and\n",
      "seats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids\n",
      "went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with\n",
      "wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that\n",
      "were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink\n",
      "they wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments\n",
      "of a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled\n",
      "perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began\n",
      "to sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I hope, sir,\" said he, \"that you will not be offended with what I\n",
      "am going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it,\n",
      "and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in\n",
      "some wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were\n",
      "to see my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs\n",
      "rather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he,\n",
      "alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes\n",
      "say that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see\n",
      "him again. And now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and\n",
      "where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner\n",
      "of ship you came in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what\n",
      "nation they declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by\n",
      "land. Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to\n",
      "this house, or have you been here in my father's time? In the old\n",
      "days we had many visitors for my father went about much himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Minerva answered, \"I will tell you truly and particularly all\n",
      "about it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians.\n",
      "I have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign\n",
      "tongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring\n",
      "back copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country\n",
      "away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron under the wooded mountain\n",
      "Neritum. Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell\n",
      "you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never\n",
      "comes to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly,\n",
      "with an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when\n",
      "he comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me\n",
      "your father was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems\n",
      "the gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on\n",
      "the mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid\n",
      "ocean, or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his\n",
      "will I am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak\n",
      "as it is borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will\n",
      "not be away much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even\n",
      "though he were in chains of iron he would find some means of getting\n",
      "home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have\n",
      "such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like\n",
      "him about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set\n",
      "sail for Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also. Since\n",
      "that time we have never either of us seen the other.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"My mother,\" answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses, but\n",
      "it is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son\n",
      "to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask\n",
      "me, there is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they\n",
      "tell me is my father.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "And Minerva said, \"There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while\n",
      "Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me\n",
      "true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these\n",
      "people? What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a\n",
      "wedding in the family- for no one seems to be bringing any provisions\n",
      "of his own? And the guests- how atrociously they are behaving; what\n",
      "riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable\n",
      "person who comes near them.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said Telemachus, \"as regards your question, so long as my father\n",
      "was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their\n",
      "displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more\n",
      "closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it\n",
      "better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before\n",
      "Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting\n",
      "were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\n",
      "ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the\n",
      "storm-winds have spirited him away we know not wither; he is gone\n",
      "without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing\n",
      "but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss\n",
      "of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind;\n",
      "for the chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland\n",
      "island of Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself,\n",
      "are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to\n",
      "my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not marry,\n",
      "nor yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate,\n",
      "and before long will do so also with myself.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that so?\" exclaimed Minerva, \"then you do indeed want Ulysses\n",
      "home again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and\n",
      "if he is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking\n",
      "and making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally\n",
      "suitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was\n",
      "then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows\n",
      "from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would\n",
      "not give him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very\n",
      "fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will\n",
      "have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return,\n",
      "and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge\n",
      "you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take\n",
      "my advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your\n",
      "case before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors\n",
      "take themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother's mind\n",
      "is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will\n",
      "find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that\n",
      "so dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon\n",
      "you to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men,\n",
      "and go in quest of your father who has so long been missing. Some\n",
      "one may tell you something, or (and people often hear things in this\n",
      "way) some heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and\n",
      "ask Nestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got\n",
      "home last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive\n",
      "and on his way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will\n",
      "make for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear\n",
      "of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with\n",
      "all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry\n",
      "again. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind\n",
      "how, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own\n",
      "house. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard\n",
      "how people are singing Orestes' praises for having killed his father's\n",
      "murderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your\n",
      "mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must\n",
      "go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep\n",
      "them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember\n",
      "what I have said to you.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"it has been very kind of you to talk\n",
      "to me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all\n",
      "you tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but\n",
      "stay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself.\n",
      "I will then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing;\n",
      "I will give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsake such as\n",
      "only dear friends give to one another.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Minerva answered, \"Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way\n",
      "at once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it\n",
      "till I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give\n",
      "me a very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in return.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had\n",
      "given Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about\n",
      "his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the\n",
      "stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors\n",
      "were sitting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as\n",
      "he told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva\n",
      "had laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his\n",
      "song from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase,\n",
      "not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached\n",
      "the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the\n",
      "roof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. She\n",
      "held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phemius,\" she cried, \"you know many another feat of gods and heroes,\n",
      "such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these,\n",
      "and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale,\n",
      "for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband\n",
      "whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all\n",
      "Hellas and middle Argos.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"let the bard sing what he has a mind\n",
      "to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they,\n",
      "who makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to\n",
      "his own good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated\n",
      "return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs\n",
      "most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the\n",
      "only man who never came back from Troy, but many another went down\n",
      "as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\n",
      "daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants;\n",
      "for speech is man's matter, and mine above all others- for it is I\n",
      "who am master here.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying\n",
      "in her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,\n",
      "she mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her\n",
      "eyes. But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters,\n",
      "and prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Telemachus spoke, \"Shameless,\" he cried, \"and insolent suitors,\n",
      "let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for\n",
      "it is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius\n",
      "has; but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you\n",
      "formal notice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and\n",
      "turn about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist\n",
      "in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with\n",
      "you in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be\n",
      "no man to avenge you.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the\n",
      "boldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, \"The\n",
      "gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may\n",
      "Jove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before\n",
      "you.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Telemachus answered, \"Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing,\n",
      "I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think\n",
      "of for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches\n",
      "and honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men\n",
      "in Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among\n",
      "them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule\n",
      "those whom Ulysses has won for me.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, \"It rests with heaven to\n",
      "decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your\n",
      "own house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man\n",
      "in Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow,\n",
      "I want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from?\n",
      "Of what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you\n",
      "news about the return of your father, or was he on business of his\n",
      "own? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that\n",
      "he was gone in a moment before we could get to know him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father is dead and gone,\" answered Telemachus, \"and even if some\n",
      "rumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed\n",
      "sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings\n",
      "no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief\n",
      "of the Taphians, an old friend of my father's.\" But in his heart he\n",
      "knew that it had been the goddess. \n",
      "\n",
      "The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening;\n",
      "but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each\n",
      "in his own abode. Telemachus's room was high up in a tower that looked\n",
      "on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and full of\n",
      "thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor,\n",
      "went before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes had bought\n",
      "her with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the worth\n",
      "of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her in his household\n",
      "as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to his bed\n",
      "for he feared his wife's resentment. She it was who now lighted Telemachus\n",
      "to his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women\n",
      "in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened\n",
      "the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as he took off\n",
      "his shirt he gave it to the good old woman, who folded it tidily up,\n",
      "and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after which she went\n",
      "out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt home\n",
      "by means of the strap. But Telemachus as he lay covered with a woollen\n",
      "fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage of the\n",

      "Ulysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house,\n",
      "and do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly,\n",
      "would have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon\n",
      "his own head if he fought against such great odds. There is no sense\n",
      "in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about\n",
      "your business, and let his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses,\n",
      "speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all- which I do not think\n",

      "of the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward\n",
      "henceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half\n",
      "done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless,\n",
      "but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins\n",
      "I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men\n",
      "as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as\n",
      "you are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are\n",
      "not entirely without some share of your father's wise discernment,\n",
      "I look with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common\n",
      "cause with any of those foolish suitors, for they have neither sense\n",
      "nor virtue, and give no thought to death and to the doom that will\n",
      "shortly fall on one and all of them, so that they shall perish on\n",
      "the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your\n",
      "father was such an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship,\n",
      "and will come with you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about\n",
      "among the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage;\n",
      "see everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal,\n",
      "which is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the\n",
      "town and beat up volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca\n",
      "both old and new; I will run my eye over them for you and will choose\n",
      "the best; we will get her ready and will put out to sea without delay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in\n",
      "doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily and found the suitors\n",
      "flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous came\n",
      "up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own, saying,\n",
      "\"Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither in\n",
      "word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The Achaeans\n",
      "will find you in everything- a ship and a picked crew to boot- so\n",
      "that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your noble\n",
      "father.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Antinous,\" answered Telemachus, \"I cannot eat in peace, nor take\n",
      "pleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that\n",
      "you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?\n",
      "Now that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger, and\n",
      "whether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do you\n",
      "all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain though,\n",
      "thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and\n",
      "must be passenger not captain.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile\n",
      "the others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeering\n",
      "at him tauntingly as they did so. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Telemachus,\" said one youngster, \"means to be the death of us; I\n",
      "suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or\n",
      "again from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to\n",
      "Ephyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another said, \"Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be\n",
      "like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should\n",
      "have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst\n",
      "us: as for the house we can let his mother and the man who marries\n",
      "her have that.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "This was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty\n",
      "and spacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronze\n",
      "lay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes\n",
      "were kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant\n",
      "olive oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit\n",
      "for a god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should\n",
      "come home again after all. The room was closed with well-made doors\n",
      "opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea,\n",
      "daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both\n",
      "night and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you\n",
      "are keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he should\n",
      "escape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve\n",
      "jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn\n",
      "leathern bags with barley meal- about twenty measures in all. Get\n",
      "these things put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will\n",
      "take everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs\n",
      "for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear\n",
      "anything about the return of my dear father. \n",
      "\n",
      "When Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him,\n",
      "saying, \"My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that\n",
      "into your head? Where in the world do you want to go to- you, who\n",
      "are the one hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in\n",
      "some foreign country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back\n",
      "is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out\n",
      "of the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves;\n",
      "stay where you are among your own people, and do not go wandering\n",
      "and worrying your life out on the barren ocean.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fear not, nurse,\" answered Telemachus, \"my scheme is not without\n",
      "heaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this\n",
      "to my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless\n",
      "she hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to\n",
      "spoil her beauty by crying.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she\n",
      "had completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars,\n",
      "and getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back\n",
      "to the suitors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape,\n",
      "and went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet\n",
      "at the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and\n",
      "asked him to let her have a ship- which he was very ready to do. When\n",
      "the sun had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship\n",
      "into the water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally\n",
      "carry, and stationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the\n",
      "crew came up, and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors\n",
      "into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made\n",
      "them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting\n",
      "over their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their\n",
      "eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice\n",
      "of Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Telemachus,\" said she, \"the men are on board and at their oars, waiting\n",
      "for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.\"\n",

      "On this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When\n",
      "they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side,\n",
      "and Telemachus said, \"Now my men, help me to get the stores on board;\n",
      "they are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not\n",
      "know anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With these words he led the way and the others followed after. When\n",
      "they had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board,\n",
      "Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel,\n",
      "while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers and\n",
      "took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair wind from\n",
      "the West, that whistled over the deep blue waves whereon Telemachus\n",
      "told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did\n",
      "as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank,\n",
      "raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted\n",
      "their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the sail\n",
      "bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue water,\n",
      "and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then they\n",
      "made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls to the\n",
      "brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from\n",
      "everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of Jove.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night\n",

      "But as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament of\n",
      "heaven to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos\n",
      "the city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea\n",
      "shore to offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.\n",
      "There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were\n",
      "nine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats and\n",
      "burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune, Telemachus\n",
      "and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship to anchor,\n",
      "and went ashore. \n",
      "\n",
      "Minerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,\n",
      "\"Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have\n",
      "taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried\n",
      "and how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may\n",
      "see what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and\n",
      "he will tell no lies, for he is an excellent person.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how, Mentor,\" replied Telemachus, \"dare I go up to Nestor, and\n",
      "how am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long\n",
      "conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one\n",
      "who is so much older than myself.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some things, Telemachus,\" answered Minerva, \"will be suggested to\n",
      "you by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for\n",
      "I am assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your\n",
      "birth until now.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "She then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till\n",
      "they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were\n",
      "assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his\n",
      "company round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces\n",
      "of meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. When they\n",
      "saw the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and\n",
      "bade them take their places. Nestor's son Pisistratus at once offered\n",
      "his hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins\n",
      "that were lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes.\n",
      "Then he gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine\n",
      "for them into a golden cup, handing it to Minerva first, and saluting\n",
      "her at the same time. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Offer a prayer, sir,\" said he, \"to King Neptune, for it is his feast\n",
      "that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink-offering,\n",
      "pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt not that\n",
      "he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without God\n",
      "in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an\n",
      "age with myself, so I he handed I will give you the precedence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and\n",
      "proper of him to have given it to herself first; she accordingly began\n",
      "praying heartily to Neptune. \"O thou,\" she cried, \"that encirclest\n",
      "the earth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call\n",
      "upon thee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor\n",
      "and on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people\n",
      "some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you.\n",
      "Lastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the\n",
      "matter that has brought us in our to Pylos.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "When she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to Telemachus\n",
      "and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were roasted\n",
      "and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his portion\n",
      "and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had had enough\n",
      "to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" said he, \"that our guests have done their dinner, it will be\n",
      "best to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you,\n",
      "and from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail\n",
      "the seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man's\n",
      "hand against you?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Telemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask\n",
      "about his father and get himself a good name. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nestor,\" said he, \"son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you\n",
      "ask whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under\n",
      "Neritum, and the matter about which I would speak is of private not\n",
      "public import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said\n",
      "to have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know\n",
      "what fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy,\n",
      "but as regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even\n",
      "that he is dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he\n",
      "perished, nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was\n",
      "lost at sea amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant\n",
      "at your knees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy\n",
      "end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some\n",
      "other traveller, for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things\n",
      "out of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what\n",
      "you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either\n",
      "by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans,\n",
      "bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend,\" answered Nestor, \"you recall a time of much sorrow to\n",
      "my mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while privateering\n",
      "under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city of king Priam.\n",
      "Our best men all of them fell there- Ajax, Achilles, Patroclus peer\n",
      "of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a man singularly\n",
      "fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much more than\n",
      "this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? Though\n",
      "you were to stay here and question me for five years, or even six,\n",
      "I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would\n",
      "turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did\n",
      "we try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against\n",
      "us; during all this time there was no one who could compare with your\n",
      "father in subtlety- if indeed you are his son- I can hardly believe\n",
      "my eyes- and you talk just like him too- no one would say that people\n",
      "of such different ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had\n",
      "any kind of difference from first to last neither in camp nor council,\n",
      "but in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how\n",
      "all might be ordered for the best. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"When however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail\n",
      "in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex\n",
      "the Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had Not all been either\n",
      "wise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the\n",
      "displeasure of Jove's daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel\n",
      "between the two sons of Atreus. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be,\n",
      "for it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they\n",
      "explained why they had called- the people together, it seemed that\n",
      "Menelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased Agamemnon,\n",
      "who thought that we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease\n",
      "the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might have known that he\n",
      "would not prevail with her, for when the gods have made up their minds\n",
      "they do not change them lightly. So the two stood bandying hard words,\n",
      "whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the\n",
      "air, and were of two minds as to what they should do. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching\n",
      "mischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships\n",
      "into the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the\n",
      "rest, about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We- the\n",
      "other half- embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven\n",
      "had smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices\n",
      "to the gods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however,\n",
      "did not yet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel\n",
      "in the course of which some among us turned their ships back again,\n",
      "and sailed away under Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon;\n",
      "but I, and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for I\n",
      "saw that mischief was brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with\n",
      "me, and his crews with him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos,\n",
      "and found us making up our minds about our course- for we did not\n",
      "know whether to go outside Chios by the island of Psyra, keeping this\n",
      "to our left, or inside Chios, over against the stormy headland of\n",
      "Mimas. So we asked heaven for a sign, and were shown one to the effect\n",
      "that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across\n",
      "the open sea to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang\n",
      "up which gave us a quick passage during the night to Geraestus, where\n",
      "we offered many sacrifices to Neptune for having helped us so far\n",
      "on our way. Four days later Diomed and his men stationed their ships\n",
      "in Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind never fell light from\n",
      "the day when heaven first made it fair for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything\n",
      "about the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who were\n",
      "lost but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports\n",
      "that have reached me since I have been here in my own house. They\n",
      "say the Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles' son Neoptolemus;\n",
      "so also did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again,\n",
      "lost no men at sea, and all his followers who escaped death in the\n",
      "field got safe home with him to Crete. No matter how far out of the\n",
      "world you live, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he\n",
      "came to at the hands of Aegisthus- and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus\n",
      "presently pay. See what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son\n",
      "behind him to do as Orestes did, who killed false Aegisthus the murderer\n",
      "of his noble father. You too, then- for you are a tall, smart-looking\n",
      "fellow- show your mettle and make yourself a name in story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nestor son of Neleus,\" answered Telemachus, \"honour to the Achaean\n",

      "all time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might\n",
      "grant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors,\n",
      "who are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no\n",
      "such happiness in store for me and for my father, so we must bear\n",
      "it as best we may.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend,\" said Nestor, \"now that you remind me, I remember to have\n",
      "heard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards\n",
      "you and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely,\n",
      "or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows\n",
      "but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels\n",
      "in full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him?\n",
      "If Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses\n",
      "when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so\n",
      "openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she\n",
      "would take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would\n",
      "soon some of them him, forget their wooing.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Telemachus answered, \"I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be\n",
      "far too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even\n",
      "though the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall\n",
      "me.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "On this Minerva said, \"Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven\n",
      "has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me, I\n",
      "should not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided\n",
      "I could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get\n",
      "home quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was\n",
      "by the treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain,\n",
      "and when a man's hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no\n",
      "matter how fond they are of him.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mentor,\" answered Telemachus, \"do not let us talk about it any more.\n",
      "There is no chance of my father's ever coming back; the gods have\n",
      "long since counselled his destruction. There is something else, however,\n",
      "about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than\n",
      "any one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so\n",
      "that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor,\n",
      "and tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What\n",
      "was Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better\n",
      "a man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging\n",
      "elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will tell you truly,\" answered Nestor, \"and indeed you have yourself\n",
      "divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy\n",
      "had found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been\n",
      "no barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would\n",
      "have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a\n",
      "woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness;\n",
      "but we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus who was\n",
      "taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon's\n",
      "wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for\n",
      "she was of a good natural disposition; moreover there was a bard with\n",
      "her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for\n",
      "Troy, that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had\n",
      "counselled her destruction, Aegisthus thus this bard off to a desert\n",
      "island and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon- after\n",
      "which she went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he\n",
      "offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples\n",
      "with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good\n",
      "terms with one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point\n",
      "of Athens, Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman\n",
      "of Menelaus' ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel\n",
      "in rough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in\n",
      "his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had\n",
      "to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral\n",
      "rites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed\n",
      "on as far as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and\n",
      "made it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided\n",
      "his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians\n",
      "dwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus. There is a high\n",
      "headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called\n",
      "Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as Phaestus the\n",
      "sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arter Phaestus\n",
      "the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great\n",
      "shelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and\n",
      "wrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the\n",
      "other five ships, they were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where\n",
      "Menelaus gathered much gold and substance among people of an alien\n",
      "speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his evil deed. For\n",
      "seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and\n",
      "the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year Orestes\n",
      "came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer of his\n",
      "father. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of\n",
      "false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very\n",
      "day Menelaus came home, with as much treasure as his ships could carry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far\n",
      "from home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your\n",
      "house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will\n",
      "have been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise you by all means\n",
      "to go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such\n",
      "distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the\n",
      "winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds\n",
      "cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so vast and terrible are\n",
      "the seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take\n",
      "your own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can\n",
      "have a chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can\n",
      "escort you to Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak\n",
      "the truth, and he will tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said,\n",
      "\"Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues\n",
      "of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings\n",
      "to Neptune, and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is\n",

      "religious festival.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men servants\n",
      "poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the\n",
      "mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\n",
      "every man his drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of the victims\n",
      "into the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings. When they\n",
      "had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded,\n",
      "Minerva and Telemachus were forgoing on board their ship, but Nestor\n",
      "caught them up at once and stayed them. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven and the immortal gods,\" he exclaimed, \"forbid that you should\n",

      "When she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and\n",
      "all marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus\n",
      "by the hand. \"My friend,\" said he, \"I see that you are going to be\n",
      "a great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you\n",
      "are still so young. This can have been none other of those who dwell\n",
      "in heaven than Jove's redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who showed\n",
      "such favour towards your brave father among the Argives.\" \"Holy queen,\"\n",
      "he continued, \"vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my good\n",
      "wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a\n",
      "broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought\n",
      "by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up\n",
      "to you in sacrifice.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way\n",
      "to his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law. When they\n",
      "had got there and had taken their places on the benches and seats,\n",
      "he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when\n",
      "the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed\n",
      "the wine, he prayed much and made drink-offerings to Minerva, daughter\n",
      "of Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink-offerings\n",
      "and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home\n",
      "to bed each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in\n",
      "the room that was over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who was\n",
      "the only unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an\n",
      "inner room of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Nestor\n",
      "left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished\n",
      "marble that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus,\n",
      "peer of gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the\n",
      "house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand, as guardian\n",
      "of the public weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round\n",
      "him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth\n",
      "son was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him\n",
      "sit with them. Nestor then addressed them. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"My sons,\" said he, \"make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first\n",
      "and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested\n",
      "herself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities. Go, then, one\n",
      "or other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer,\n",
      "and come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus's\n",
      "ship, and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the\n",
      "vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to\n",
      "gild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you\n",
      "are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and\n",
      "to fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also-\n",
      "to bring me some clear spring water.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "On this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was\n",
      "brought in from the plain, and Telemachus's crew came from the ship;\n",
      "the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he\n",
      "worked his gold, and Minerva herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor\n",
      "gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that\n",
      "the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and\n",
      "Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the\n",
      "house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other\n",
      "hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by\n",
      "with a sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a\n",
      "bucket. Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the\n",
      "barley meal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a\n",
      "lock from the heifer's head upon the fire. \n",
      "\n",
      "When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal Thrasymedes\n",
      "dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut\n",
      "through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters\n",
      "and daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she\n",
      "was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they\n",
      "lifted the heifer's head from off the ground, and Pisistratus cut\n",
      "her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut\n",
      "her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them\n",
      "round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the\n",
      "top of them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine\n",
      "over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits\n",
      "in their hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the\n",
      "inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces\n",
      "on the spits and toasted them over the fire. \n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed Telemachus.\n",
      "When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought him\n",
      "a fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as he came from\n",
      "the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the outer meats\n",
      "were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where\n",
      "they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them\n",
      "out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had had enough\n",
      "to eat and drink Nestor said, \"Sons, put Telemachus's horses to the\n",
      "chariot that he may start at once.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the\n",
      "fleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision\n",
      "of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemachus\n",
      "got into the chariot, while Pisistratus gathered up the reins and\n",
      "took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they flew forward\n",
      "nothing loth into the open country, leaving the high citadel of Pylos\n",
      "behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon their\n",
      "necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land. Then\n",
      "they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus\n",
      "and grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diocles entertained\n",
      "them hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared,\n",
      "they again yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under\n",
      "the echoing gatehouse. Pisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew\n",
      "forward nothing loth; presently they came to the corn lands Of the\n",
      "open country, and in the course of time completed their journey, so\n",
      "well did their steeds take them. \n",

      "They reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon them where they drove\n",
      "straight to the of abode Menelaus [and found him in his own house,\n",
      "feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son,\n",
      "and also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that\n",
      "valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her\n",
      "to him while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing\n",
      "the marriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses\n",
      "to the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles' son was reigning.\n",
      "For his only son he had found a bride from Sparta, daughter of Alector.\n",
      "This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven\n",
      "vouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who\n",
      "was fair as golden Venus herself. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making\n",
      "merry in his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play\n",
      "his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of\n",
      "them when the man struck up with his tune.] \n",
      "\n",
      "Telemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,\n",
      "whereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw\n",
      "them ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went\n",
      "close up to him and said, \"Menelaus, there are some strangers come\n",
      "here, two men, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall\n",
      "we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as\n",
      "they best can?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Menelaus was very angry and said, \"Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you\n",
      "never used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their\n",
      "horses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have\n",
      "supper; you and I have stayed often enough at other people's houses\n",
      "before we got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace\n",
      "henceforward.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "So Eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. They\n",
      "took their sweating hands from under the yoke, made them fast to the\n",
      "mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they\n",
      "leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led\n",
      "the way into the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished\n",
      "when they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon;\n",
      "then, when they had admired everything to their heart's content, they\n",
      "went into the bath room and washed themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they\n",
      "brought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats\n",
      "by the side of Menelaus. A maidservant brought them water in a beautiful\n",
      "golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their\n",
      "hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought\n",
      "them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in\n",
      "the house, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats\n",
      "and set cups of gold by their side. \n",
      "\n",
      "Menelaus then greeted them saying, \"Fall to, and welcome; when you\n",
      "have done supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such\n",
      "men as you cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line\n",
      "of sceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as\n",
      "you are.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "On this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set\n",
      "near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good\n",
      "things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat\n",
      "and drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so\n",
      "close that no one might hear, \"Look, Pisistratus, man after my own\n",
      "heart, see the gleam of bronze and gold- of amber, ivory, and silver.\n",
      "Everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian\n",
      "Jove. I am lost in admiration.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Menelaus overheard him and said, \"No one, my sons, can hold his own\n",
      "with Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but\n",
      "among mortal men- well, there may be another who has as much wealth\n",
      "as I have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much\n",
      "and have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before\n",
      "I could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the\n",
      "Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians,\n",
      "and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born,\n",
      "and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that country,\n",
      "whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk,\n",
      "for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was travelling\n",
      "and getting great riches among these people, my brother was secretly\n",
      "and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, so\n",
      "that I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever\n",
      "your parents may be they must have told you about all this, and of\n",
      "my heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully and magnificently\n",
      "furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so that\n",
      "I had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the\n",
      "plain of Troy, far from Argos. I of grieve, as I sit here in my house,\n",
      "for one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently\n",
      "I leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of\n",
      "it. Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so for one man more than for\n",
      "them all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and\n",
      "sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one of all the Achaeans\n",
      "worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing by it,\n",
      "and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a\n",
      "long time, and we know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father,\n",
      "his long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he\n",
      "left behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought\n",
      "him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned,\n",
      "so that he held his cloak before his face with both hands. When Menelaus\n",
      "saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking,\n",
      "or to ask him at once and find what it was all about. \n",
      "\n",
      "While he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted\n",
      "and perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought\n",
      "her a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the\n",
      "silver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus\n",
      "lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world;\n",
      "he gave Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and\n",
      "ten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful\n",
      "presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work-box that ran\n",
      "on wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed\n",
      "this by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with\n",
      "violet coloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took\n",
      "her seat, put her feet upon the footstool, and began to question her\n",
      "husband. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do we know, Menelaus,\" said she, \"the names of these strangers who\n",
      "have come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?-but I cannot\n",
      "help saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman\n",
      "so like somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what\n",
      "to think) as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left\n",
      "as a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in\n",
      "your hearts, on account of my most shameless self.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear wife,\" replied Menelaus, \"I see the likeness just as you\n",
      "do. His hands and feet are just like Ulysses'; so is his hair, with\n",
      "the shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when\n",
      "I was talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on\n",
      "my account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Pisistratus said, \"Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in\n",
      "thinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest,\n",
      "and is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one\n",
      "whose conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My father,\n",
      "Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether\n",
      "you could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble\n",
      "at home when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters;\n",
      "and this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent,\n",
      "and there is no one among his own people to stand by him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless my heart,\" replied Menelaus, \"then I am receiving a visit from\n",
      "the son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake.\n",
      "I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when\n",
      "heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should\n",
      "have founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should\n",
      "have made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people,\n",
      "and should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities\n",
      "that are subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually,\n",
      "and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an\n",
      "intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great\n",
      "good fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting\n",
      "home at all.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,\n",
      "Telemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his\n",
      "eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus\n",
      "whom the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told\n",
      "me you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then,\n",
      "it be possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while\n",
      "I am getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the\n",
      "forenoon I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone.\n",
      "This is all we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads\n",
      "for them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who\n",
      "died at Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure\n",
      "to have known him- his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon\n",
      "him myself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and\n",
      "in fight valiant.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your discretion, my friend,\" answered Menelaus, \"is beyond your years.\n",
      "It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man\n",
      "is son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring-\n",
      "and it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days, giving\n",
      "him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who are\n",
      "both we disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all\n",
      "this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water be poured\n",
      "over our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in\n",
      "the morning.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "On this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands\n",
      "and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Jove's daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged\n",
      "the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour.\n",
      "Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the\n",
      "rest of the day, not even though his father and mother both of them\n",
      "drop down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before\n",
      "his very eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had\n",
      "been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where\n",
      "there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into the mixing-bowl\n",
      "and others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country is\n",
      "a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen\n",
      "had put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve\n",
      "the wine round, she said: \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable\n",
      "men (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and\n",
      "evil, and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen\n",
      "while I tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single\n",
      "one of the exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he\n",
      "was before Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties.\n",
      "He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in\n",
      "rags, and entered the enemy's city looking like a menial or a beggar.\n",
      "and quite different from what he did when he was among his own people.\n",
      "In this disguise he entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything\n",
      "to him. I alone recognized him and began to question him, but he was\n",
      "too cunning for me. When, however, I had washed and anointed him and\n",
      "had given him clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not to\n",
      "betray him to the Trojans till he had got safely back to his own camp\n",
      "and to the ships, he told me all that the Achaeans meant to do. He\n",
      "killed many Trojans and got much information before he reached the\n",
      "Argive camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation,\n",
      "but for my own part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to oam\n",
      "after my home, and I was unhappy about wrong that Venus had done me\n",
      "in taking me over there, away from my country, my girl, and my lawful\n",
      "wedded husband, who is indeed by no means deficient either in person\n",
      "or understanding.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Menelaus said, \"All that you have been saying, my dear wife,\n",
      "is true. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes,\n",
      "but I have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance\n",
      "too, and what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein\n",
      "all the bravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and\n",
      "destruction upon the Trojans. At that moment you came up to us; some\n",
      "god who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and\n",
      "you had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding\n",
      "place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and\n",
      "mimicked all our wives -Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside\n",
      "heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds\n",
      "whether to spring out then and there, or to answer you from inside,\n",
      "but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except\n",
      "Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped his\n",
      "two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this\n",
      "that saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away\n",
      "again.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"How sad,\" exclaimed Telemachus, \"that all this was of no avail to\n",
      "save him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to\n",
      "send us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon\n",
      "of sleep.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "On this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that\n",
      "was in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread\n",
      "coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to\n",
      "wear. So the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds,\n",
      "to which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then,\n",
      "did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while\n",
      "the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaus\n",
      "rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,\n",
      "girded his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like\n",
      "an immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to\n",
      "Lacedaemon? Are you on public or private business? Tell me all about\n",
      "it.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have come, sir replied Telemachus, \"to see if you can tell me anything\n",
      "about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my fair estate\n",
      "is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing\n",
      "great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying their\n",
      "addresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your knees if\n",
      "haply you may tell me about my father's melancholy end, whether you\n",
      "saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller;\n",
      "for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any\n",
      "pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw.\n",
      "If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by word\n",
      "or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in\n",
      "mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. \"So,\" he exclaimed,\n",
      "\"these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well\n",
      "lay her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed\n",
      "in the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back\n",
      "to his lair will make short work with the pair of them- and so will\n",
      "Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if\n",
      "Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides\n",
      "in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered\n",
      "him- if he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they\n",
      "would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions,\n",
      "however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you\n",
      "without concealment all that the old man of the sea told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt,\n",
      "for my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods\n",
      "are very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far\n",
      "as a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there\n",
      "is an island called Pharos- it has a good harbour from which vessels\n",
      "can get out into open sea when they have taken in water- and the gods\n",
      "becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to\n",
      "help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my\n",
      "men would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and\n",
      "saved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man\n",

      "tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to take, and how\n",
      "you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also tell\n",

      "along by the sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the goddess\n",
      "fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them\n",
      "just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father. Then\n",
      "she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should\n",
      "come up. When we were close to her, she made us lie down in the pits\n",
      "one after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our ambuscade\n",
      "would have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was\n",
      "most distressing- who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could\n",
      "help it?-but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of something\n",
      "that gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under each man's\n",

      "to sleep as soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him\n",
      "with a shout and seized him; on which he began at once with his old\n",

      "he would have escaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting.\n",
      "He said the gods could not drown him even though they had tried to\n",
      "do so, and when Neptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident\n",
      "in his two brawny hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces.\n",
      "The base remained where it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting\n",
      "fell headlong into the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he drank salt\n",

      "in ambuscade on one side the cloister, while on the opposite side\n",
      "he prepared a banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon,\n",
      "and invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there,\n",
      "all unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him\n",

      "rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and\n",
      "put our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves,\n",

      "I again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and\n",

      "any present you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that it should\n",

      "giving us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown.\n",
      "Find me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie\n",
      "in wait for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then\n",
      "rue the day that he set out to try and get news of his father.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "It was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were plotting;\n",

      "as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell his mistress.\n",
      "As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said: \"Medon, what\n",

      "their master's business and cook dinner for them? I wish they may\n",
      "neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else,\n",
      "but let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of\n",
      "my son's estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children\n",
      "how good Ulysses had been to them- never doing anything high-handed,\n",
      "nor speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and\n",
      "they may take a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Ulysses\n",
      "never did an unjust thing by anybody- which shows what bad hearts\n",
      "you have, and that there is no such thing as gratitude left in this\n",
      "world.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Medon said, \"I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are\n",

      "\n",
      "Then Penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she was\n",

      "At last, however, she said, \"Why did my son leave me? What business\n",
      "had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction\n",
      "than any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave\n",
      "and lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven,\n",
      "and whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now\n",
      "my darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my\n",
      "having heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was\n",
      "not one of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my\n",
      "bed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If\n",
      "I had known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give\n",
      "it up, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse\n",
      "behind him- one or other. Now, however, go some of you and call old\n",
      "Dolius, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is my\n",
      "gardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything to Laertes, who may\n",
      "be able to hit on some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side,\n",
      "as against those who are trying to exterminate his own race and that\n",
      "of Ulysses.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the dear old nurse Euryclea said, \"You may kill me, Madam, or\n",
      "let me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell\n",
      "you the real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he\n",
      "wanted in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn\n",
      "oath that I would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days,\n",
      "unless you asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did\n",
      "not want you to spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash\n",
      "your face, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer\n",
      "prayers to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save\n",
      "him even though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes:\n",
      "he has trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods\n",
      "hate die race of the race of the son of Arceisius so much, but there\n",
      "will be a son left to come up after him, and inherit both the house\n",
      "and the fair fields that lie far all round it.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "With these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried\n",
      "the tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress,\n",
      "and went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley\n",
      "into a basket and began praying to Minerva. \n",

      "son from the villainy of the suitors.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "She cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer; meanwhile\n",
      "the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister, and one\n",
      "of them said: \n",
      "\n",
      "\"The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.\n",
      "Little does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was what they said, but they did not know what was going to happen.\n",

      "about which we are all of a mind.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "He then chose twenty men, and they went down to their. ship and to\n",
      "the sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast\n",
      "and sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted\n",
      "thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft,\n",
      "while their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made\n",

      "into a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in\n",
      "the likeness of Penelope's sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who\n",
      "had married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go\n",
      "to the house of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so\n",

      "\n",
      "Penelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,\n",
      "\"Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I\n",
      "suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then,\n",
      "to leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture\n",
      "me? I, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every\n",
      "good quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas\n",
      "and middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of\n",
      "a ship- a foolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor\n",
      "to going about among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about\n",
      "him than about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him,\n",
      "lest something should happen to him, either from the people among\n",
      "whom he has gone, or by sea, for he has many enemies who are plotting\n",
      "against him, and are bent on killing him before he can return home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the vision said, \"Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. There\n",
      "is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have\n",
      "stand by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon\n",
      "you, and who has sent me to bear you this message.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" said Penelope, \"if you are a god or have been sent here by\n",

      "still alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the vision said, \"I shall not tell you for certain whether he\n",

      "\n",
      "Then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated\n",

      "country, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and\r\n",
      "let me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see\r\n",
      "this wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after\r\n",
      "day; yet I flatter myself that at am no whit less tall or well-looking\r\n",
      "than she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should\r\n",
      "compare in beauty with an immortal.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Goddess,\" replied Ulysses, \"do not be angry with me about this. I\r\n",
      "am quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so\r\n",
      "beautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal.\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothing else. If\r\n",
      "some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and make the\r\n",

      "so let this go with the rest.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired\r\n",
      "into the inner part of the cave and went to bed. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Ulysses put\r\n",
      "on his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light\r\n",
      "gossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle\r\n",
      "about her waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself\r\n",
      "to think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave him a\r\n",
      "great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides,\r\n",
      "and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She\r\n",
      "also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of\r\n",
      "the island where the largest trees grew- alder, poplar and pine, that\r\n",
      "reached the sky- very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for\r\n",
      "him in the water. Then, when she had shown him where the best trees\r\n",
      "grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished\r\n",
      "doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring\r\n",
      "them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back\r\n",
      "with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers\r\n",
      "together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled\r\n",
      "shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he filed a deck on\r\n",
      "top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast\r\n",
      "with a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all\r\n",
      "round with wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then\r\n",
      "he threw on a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso brought him some\r\n",
      "linen to make the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making\r\n",
      "them fast with braces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers,\r\n",
      "he drew the raft down into the water. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso\r\n",
      "sent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean\r\n",
      "clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another\r\n",
      "larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions,\r\n",
      "and found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair\r\n",
      "and warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it,\r\n",
      "while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder.\r\n",
      "He never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting\r\n",
      "Bootes, and on the Bear- which men also call the wain, and which turns\r\n",
      "round and round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping\r\n",
      "into the stream of Oceanus- for Calypso had told him to keep this\r\n",
      "to his left. Days seven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the\r\n",
      "eighteenth the dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of\r\n",
      "the Phaeacian coast appeared, rising like a shield on the horizon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight\r\n",
      "of Ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could\r\n",
      "see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged\r\n",
      "his head and muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so the gods have\r\n",
      "been changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia,\r\n",
      "and now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed\r\n",
      "that he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. Still,\r\n",
      "he shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred\r\n",
      "it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows\r\n",
      "till earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth\r\n",
      "out of the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon\r\n",
      "him all at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses'\r\n",

      "In spite of all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft,\r\n",

      "take it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then\r\n",
      "go away again.\" With these words she took off her veil and gave it\r\n",

      "when the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm\r\n",
      "without so much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell\r\n",

      "swell still broke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was\r",
      "\r\n",
      "enveloped in spray; there were no harbours where a ship might ride,\r\n",
      "nor shelter of any kind, but only headlands, low-lying rocks, and\r\n",
      "mountain tops. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to\r\n",
      "himself, \"Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that\r\n",
      "I had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the\r\n",
      "coast is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer\r\n",
      "from the sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannot climb\r\n",
      "out for want of foothold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me\r\n",
      "off my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the water- which\r\n",
      "would give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further\r\n",
      "in search of some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry\r\n",
      "me out to sea again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some\r\n",
      "great monster of the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "While he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with\r\n",
      "such force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn\r\n",
      "to pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold\r\n",
      "of the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till\r\n",
      "the wave retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave\r\n",
      "came on again and carried him back with it far into the sea-tearing\r\n",

      "it from its bed, and the stones come up along with it even so did\r\n",

      "Here poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his\r\n",
      "own destiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about\r\n",
      "him. He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating\r\n",
      "against the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the\r\n",
      "shore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take\r\n",
      "the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of\r\n",
      "a river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there were\r\n",
      "no rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there\r\n",
      "was a current, so he prayed inwardly and said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of\r\n",
      "the sea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has\r\n",
      "lost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore\r\n",
      "in my distress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees\r\n",
      "of your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself\r\n",
      "your suppliant.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the god stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm\r\n",
      "before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here\r\n",
      "at last Ulysses' knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had\r\n",
      "completely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and\r\n",
      "nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither\r\n",
      "breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,\r\n",
      "when he had got his breath and came to himself again, he took off\r\n",
      "the scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt stream\r\n",
      "of the river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave\r\n",
      "that bore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down\r\n",
      "among the rushes, and kissed the bounteous earth. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alas,\" he cried to himself in his dismay, \"what ever will become\r\n",
      "of me, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed\r\n",
      "through the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the\r\n",
      "bitter cold and damp may make an end of me- for towards sunrise there\r\n",
      "will be a keen wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand,\r\n",
      "I climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some\r\n",
      "thicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night's rest, but some\r\n",
      "savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one\r\n",
      "upon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath\r\n",
      "two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock- the one an ungrafted\r\n",
      "sucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally,\r\n",
      "could break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun's rays\r\n",
      "pierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow\r\n",
      "into one another. Ulysses crept under these and began to make himself\r\n",
      "a bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying\r\n",
      "about- enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard\r\n",
      "winter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself\r\n",
      "down and heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone\r\n",
      "in the country, far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed\r\n",
      "in the ashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere,\r\n",
      "even so did Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and Minerva shed\r\n",
      "a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose\r\n",

      "shall get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "On this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out,\r\n",
      "harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the clothes\r\n",
      "down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her mother\r\n",
      "prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good things,\r\n",
      "and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon, and\r\n",
      "her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her women\r\n",
      "might anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and reins and lashed\r\n",
      "the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on the\r\n",
      "road. They pulled without flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa\r\n",
      "and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were with her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they reached the water side they went to the washing-cisterns,\r\n",
      "through which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any\r\n",
      "quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the\r\n",
      "mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that\r\n",
      "grew by the water side. They took the clothes out of the waggon, put\r\n",
      "them in the water, and vied with one another in treading them in the\r\n",
      "pits to get the dirt out. After they had washed them and got them\r\n",
      "quite clean, they laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had\r\n",
      "raised a high beach of shingle, and set about washing themselves and\r\n",
      "anointing themselves with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by\r\n",
      "the side of the stream, and waited for the sun to finish drying the\r\n",
      "clothes. When they had done dinner they threw off the veils that covered\r\n",
      "their heads and began to play at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them.\r\n",
      "As the huntress Diana goes forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or\r\n",
      "Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer, and the wood-nymphs, daughters\r\n",
      "of Aegis-bearing Jove, take their sport along with her (then is Leto\r\n",
      "proud at seeing her daughter stand a full head taller than the others,\r\n",
      "and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so\r\n",
      "did the girl outshine her handmaids. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the\r\n",
      "clothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider\r\n",
      "how Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct\r\n",
      "him to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball\r\n",
      "at one of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On\r\n",
      "this they all shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, who sat\r\n",
      "up in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alas,\" said he to himself, \"what kind of people have I come amongst?\r\n",
      "Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilized, or hospitable and humane?\r\n",
      "I seem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those\r\n",
      "of the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows\r\n",
      "of green grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let\r\n",
      "me try if I cannot manage to get a look at them.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough\r\n",
      "covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some\r\n",
      "lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength\r\n",
      "and defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest\r\n",
      "of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even\r\n",
      "into a well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep- even such\r\n",
      "did Ulysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to them all naked\r\n",
      "as he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and\r\n",
      "so begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off along the spits\r\n",
      "that jutted out into the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm,\r\n",
      "for Minerva put courage into her heart and took away all fear from\r\n",
      "her. She stood right in front of Ulysses, and he doubted whether he\r\n",
      "should go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees\r\n",
      "as a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her to give him some\r\n",
      "clothes and show him the way to the town. In the end he deemed it\r\n",
      "best to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offence\r\n",
      "at his coming near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her\r\n",
      "in honeyed and persuasive language. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"O queen,\" he said, \"I implore your aid- but tell me, are you a goddess\r\n",
      "or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven,\r\n",
      "I can only conjecture that you are Jove's daughter Diana, for your\r\n",
      "face and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are\r\n",
      "a mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your father and mother-\r\n",
      "thrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and delighted\r\n",
      "they must feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself going out\r\n",
      "to a dance; most happy, however, of all will he be whose wedding gifts\r\n",
      "have been the richest, and who takes you to his own home. I never\r\n",
      "yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am lost in\r\n",
      "admiration as I behold you. I can only compare you to a young palm\r\n",
      "tree which I saw when I was at Delos growing near the altar of Apollo-\r\n",
      "for I was there, too, with much people after me, when I was on that\r\n",
      "journey which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet did\r\n",
      "such a young plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and I admired\r\n",
      "and wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at yourself.\r\n",
      "I dare not clasp your knees, but I am in great distress; yesterday\r\n",
      "made the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the sea.\r\n",
      "The winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian island,\r\n",
      "and now fate has flung me upon this coast that I may endure still\r\n",
      "further suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come to the\r\n",
      "end of it, but rather that heaven has still much evil in store for\r\n",
      "me. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person\r\n",
      "I have met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way\r\n",
      "to your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither\r\n",
      "to wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart's\r\n",
      "desire- husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing\r\n",
      "better in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind\r\n",
      "in a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their\r\n",

      "apart on a land's end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing\r\n",
      "to do with any other people. This is only some poor man who has lost\r\n",

      "in distress are under Jove's protection, and will take what they can\r\n",

      "from the wind.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "back. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told\r\n",
      "them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the\r\n",
      "little golden cruse of oil, and told him to go wash in the stream.\r\n",

      "to strip before a number of good-looking young women.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses\r\n",
      "washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back\r\n",
      "and from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself,\r\n",
      "and had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil,\r\n",
      "and put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then\r\n",
      "made him look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair\r\n",
      "grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth\r\n",
      "blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful\r\n",
      "workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva\r\n",
      "enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it- and his work is full\r\n",
      "of beauty. Then he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach,\r\n",
      "looking quite young and handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration;\r\n",
      "then she said to her maids: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who\r\n",
      "live in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first\r\n",
      "saw him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of\r\n",
      "the gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be\r\n",
      "just such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want\r\n",
      "to go away. However, give him something to eat and drink.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and\r\n",
      "drank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen\r\n",
      "folded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as\r\n",
      "she took her seat, she called Ulysses: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stranger,\" said she, \"rise and let us be going back to the town;\r\n",
      "I will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I\r\n",
      "can tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaecians.\r\n",
      "But be sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be a sensible person.\r\n",
      "As long as we are going past the fields- and farm lands, follow briskly\r\n",
      "behind the waggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself.\r\n",
      "Presently, however, we shall come to the town, where you will find\r\n",
      "a high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on either side\r\n",
      "with a narrow entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn\r\n",
      "up by the road side, for every one has a place where his own ship\r\n",
      "can lie. You will see the market place with a temple of Neptune in\r\n",
      "the middle of it, and paved with large stones bedded in the earth.\r\n",
      "Here people deal in ship's gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails,\r\n",
      "and here, too, are the places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians\r\n",
      "are not a nation of archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows,\r\n",
      "but are a sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars,\r\n",
      "and ships, with which they travel far over the sea. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against\r\n",
      "me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low\r\n",
      "fellow, if he met us, might say, 'Who is this fine-looking stranger\r\n",
      "that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she End him? I suppose\r\n",
      "she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she\r\n",
      "has taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or\r\n",
      "some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to her prayers,\r\n",
      "and she is going to live with him all the rest of her life. It would\r\n",
      "be a good thing if she would take herself of I for sh and find a husband\r\n",
      "somewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent\r\n",
      "young Phaeacians who are in with her.' This is the kind of disparaging\r\n",
      "remark that would be made about me, and I could not complain, for\r\n",
      "I should myself be scandalized at seeing any other girl do the like,\r\n",
      "and go about with men in spite of everybody, while her father and\r\n",
      "mother were still alive, and without having been married in the face\r\n",
      "of all the world. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help\r\n",
      "you home, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars\r\n",
      "by the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow\r\n",
      "all round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about\r\n",
      "as far from the town as a man' voice will carry. Sit down there and\r\n",
      "wait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach\r\n",
      "my father's house. Then, when you think we must have done this, come\r\n",
      "into the town and ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous.\r\n",
      "You will have no difficulty in finding it; any child will point it\r\n",
      "out to you, for no one else in the whole town has anything like such\r\n",
      "a fine house as he has. When you have got past the gates and through\r\n",
      "the outer court, go right across the inner court till you come to\r\n",
      "my mother. You will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her\r\n",
      "purple wool by firelight. It is a fine sight to see her as she leans\r\n",
      "back against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind\r\n",
      "her. Close to her seat stands that of my father, on which he sits\r\n",
      "and topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my mother,\r\n",
      "and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If\r\n",
      "you can gain her over, you may hope to see your own country again,\r\n",
      "no matter how distant it may be.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.\r\n",
      "The mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.\r\n",
      "She was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were\r\n",
      "following on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with\r\n",
      "judgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove\r\n",
      "of Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter\r\n",
      "of Jove. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable,\r\n",
      "hear me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was wrecking\r\n",
      "me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends\r\n",
      "and be hospitably received by the Phaecians.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not\r\n",
      "show herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune,\r\n",
      "who was still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting\r\n",

      "Thus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the\r\n",

      "and her brothers- comely as the gods- gathered round her, took the\r\n",

      "of bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun\r\n",
      "or moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end,\r\n",
      "and the cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung\r\n",
      "on pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel\r\n",
      "was silver and the hook of the door was of gold. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan,\r\n",
      "with his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over\r\n",
      "the palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never\r\n",
      "grow old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from\r\n",
      "one end to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the\r\n",
      "women of the house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaecians\r\n",
      "used to sit and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons;\r\n",
      "and there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in\r\n",
      "their hands, raised on pedestals, to give light by night to those\r\n",
      "who were at table. There are fifty maid servants in the house, some\r\n",
      "of whom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others\r\n",
      "work at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go, backwards\r\n",
      "and forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen\r\n",
      "is so closely woven that it will turn oil. As the Phaecians are the\r\n",
      "best sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving,\r\n",
      "for Minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are\r\n",
      "very intelligent. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about\r\n",
      "four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful trees-\r\n",
      "pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are luscious\r\n",
      "figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail\r\n",
      "all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so soft\r\n",
      "that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on pear,\r\n",
      "apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for there\r\n",
      "is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this, the\r\n",
      "grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being\r\n",
      "gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further\r\n",
      "on have shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others\r\n",
      "again are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground\r\n",
      "there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all\r\n",
      "the year round. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts\r\n",
      "throughout the whole garden, while the other is carried under the\r\n",
      "ground of the outer court to the house itself, and the town's people\r\n",
      "draw water from it. Such, then, were the splendours with which the\r\n",
      "gods had endowed the house of king Alcinous. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he\r\n",
      "had looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\r\n",
      "precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among\r\n",
      "the Phaecians making their drink-offerings to Mercury, which they\r\n",
      "always did the last thing before going away for the night. He went\r\n",
      "straight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness\r\n",
      "in which Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King\r\n",
      "Alcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and\r\n",
      "at that moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became\r\n",
      "visible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\r\n",
      "but Ulysses began at once with his petition. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Queen Arete,\" he exclaimed, \"daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress\r\n",
      "I humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom\r\n",
      "may heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave\r\n",
      "their possessions to their children, and all the honours conferred\r\n",
      "upon them by the state) to help me home to my own country as soon\r\n",
      "as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my friends.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their\r\n",
      "peace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent\r\n",
      "speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty\r\n",
      "addressed them thus: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alcinous,\" said he, \"it is not creditable to you that a stranger\r\n",
      "should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is\r\n",
      "waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise\r\n",
      "and take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants\r\n",
      "mix some wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to Jove\r\n",
      "the lord of thunder, who takes all well-disposed suppliants under\r\n",
      "his protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever\r\n",
      "there may be in the house.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from\r\n",
      "the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting\r\n",
      "beside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought\r\n",
      "him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin\r\n",
      "for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him;\r\n",
      "an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many good things\r\n",
      "of what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous\r\n",
      "said to one of the servants, \"Pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand\r\n",
      "it round that we may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder,\r\n",
      "who is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving\r\n",
      "every man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings,\r\n",
      "and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\r\n",
      "have had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall\r\n",
      "invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial\r\n",
      "banquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of\r\n",
      "his escort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing\r\n",
      "to his own country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no\r\n",
      "matter how distant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm\r\n",
      "while on his homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will\r\n",
      "have to take the luck he was born with for better or worse like other\r\n",
      "people. It is possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals\r\n",
      "who has come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods\r\n",
      "are departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made\r\n",
      "themselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them hecatombs.\r\n",
      "They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves, and if\r\n",
      "any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other of\r\n",
      "them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the\r\n",
      "gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Ulysses said: \"Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into\r\n",
      "your head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body\r\n",
      "nor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.\r\n",
      "Indeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon\r\n",
      "me, you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,\r\n",
      "let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very importunate\r\n",
      "thing, and thrusts itself on a man's notice no matter how dire is\r\n",
      "his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall eat\r\n",
      "and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only\r\n",
      "on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose,\r\n",
      "and at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content\r\n",
      "to die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and\r\n",
      "all the greatness of my house.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that\r\n",
      "he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then\r\n",
      "when they had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much\r\n",
      "as he was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode,\r\n",
      "leaving Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the\r\n",
      "servants were taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first\r\n",
      "to speak, for she recognized the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that\r\n",
      "Ulysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she\r\n",
      "said, \"Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should\r\n",
      "like to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes?\r\n",
      "Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Ulysses answered, \"It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate\r\n",
      "in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been\r\n",
      "laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island\r\n",
      "far away in the sea which is called 'the Ogygian.' Here dwells the\r\n",
      "cunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives\r\n",
      "by herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however,\r\n",
      "me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my ship with\r\n",
      "his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades\r\n",
      "were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried\r\n",
      "hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during\r\n",
      "the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian\r\n",
      "island where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated\r\n",
      "me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal\r\n",
      "that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let\r\n",
      "her do so. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the\r\n",
      "good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but\r\n",
      "at last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her\r\n",
      "own free will, either because Jove had told her she must, or because\r\n",
      "she had changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which\r\n",
      "she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave\r\n",
      "me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and\r\n",
      "fair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth\r\n",
      "I caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast-\r\n",
      "and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was\r\n",
      "still much trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would\r\n",
      "let me go no further, and raised a great storm against me; the sea\r\n",
      "was so terribly high that I could no longer keep to my raft, which\r\n",
      "went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I had to swim for it,\r\n",
      "till wind and current brought me to your shores. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and\r\n",
      "the waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea\r\n",
      "and swam on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing\r\n",
      "place, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind.\r\n",
      "Here, then, I got out of the water and gathered my senses together\r\n",
      "again. Night was coming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket,\r\n",
      "where I covered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven\r\n",
      "sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept\r\n",
      "among the leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon,\r\n",
      "when I woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter's maid\r\n",
      "servants playing upon the beach, and your daughter among them looking\r\n",
      "like a goddess. I besought her aid, and she proved to be of an excellent\r\n",
      "disposition, much more so than could be expected from so young a person-\r\n",
      "for young people are apt to be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of\r\n",
      "bread and wine, and when she had had me washed in the river she also\r\n",
      "gave me the clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it\r\n",
      "has pained me to do so, I have told you the whole truth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Alcinous said, \"Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not\r\n",
      "to bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that\r\n",
      "she was the first person whose aid you asked.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pray do not scold her,\" replied Ulysses; \"she is not to blame. She\r\n",
      "did tell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and\r\n",
      "afraid, for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me.\r\n",
      "Every human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stranger,\" replied Alcinous, \"I am not the kind of man to get angry\r\n",
      "about nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father\r\n",
      "Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you\r\n",
      "are, and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry\r\n",
      "my daughter, and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give\r\n",
      "you a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you\r\n",
      "here against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will\r\n",
      "attend to-morrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep during\r\n",
      "the whole voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth\r\n",
      "waters either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though\r\n",
      "it be a long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people\r\n",
      "who saw it when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus\r\n",
      "the son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place- and yet they\r\n",
      "did the whole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves,\r\n",
      "and came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships\r\n",
      "excel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, \"Father Jove, grant\r\n",
      "that Alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable\r\n",
      "name among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in\r\n",
      "the room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs,\r\n",
      "and to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for\r\n",
      "Ulysses to wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their\r\n",
      "hands, and when they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and\r\n",
      "said, \"Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,\"\r\n",
      "and glad indeed was he to go to his rest. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;\r\n",
      "but Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his\r\n",
      "wife by his side. \r\n",

      "Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous\r\n",
      "and Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaecian place\r\n",
      "of assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat\r\n",
      "down side by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took\r\n",
      "the form of one of Alcinous' servants, and went round the town in\r\n",
      "order to help Ulysses to get home. She went up to the citizens, man\r\n",
      "by man, and said, \"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,\r\n",
      "come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has\r\n",
      "just come off a long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks\r\n",
      "like an immortal god.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked\r\n",
      "to the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every\r\n",
      "one was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified\r\n",
      "him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter\r\n",
      "than he really was, that he might impress the Phaecians favourably\r\n",
      "as being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many\r\n",
      "trials of skill to which they would challenge him. Then, when they\r\n",
      "were got together, Alcinous spoke: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hear me,\" said he, \"aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,\r\n",
      "that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may\r\n",
      "be, has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East\r\n",
      "or West. He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled.\r\n",
      "Let us then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before\r\n",
      "him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to\r\n",
      "complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw\r\n",
      "a ship into the sea- one that has never yet made a voyage- and man\r\n",
      "her with two and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you\r\n",
      "have made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and\r\n",
      "come to my house to prepare a feast. I will find you in everything.\r\n",
      "I am giving will these instructions to the young men who will form\r\n",
      "the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will\r\n",
      "join me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters. I can take no\r\n",
      "excuses, and we will have Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no\r\n",
      "bard like him whatever he may choose to sing about.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a\r\n",
      "servant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went\r\n",
      "to the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they\r\n",
      "drew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound\r\n",
      "the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in\r\n",
      "due course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel\r\n",
      "a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the\r\n",
      "house of King Alcinous. The outhouses, yards, and all the precincts\r\n",
      "were filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young;\r\n",
      "and Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and\r\n",
      "two oxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent\r\n",
      "banquet. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse\r\n",
      "had dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for\r\n",
      "though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed\r\n",
      "him of his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests,\r\n",
      "leaning it up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on\r\n",
      "a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with\r\n",
      "his hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his\r\n",
      "side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was\r\n",
      "so disposed. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before\r\n",
      "them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse\r\n",
      "inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially\r\n",
      "a matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel\r\n",
      "between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped\r\n",
      "on one another as they gat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was\r\n",
      "glad when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for\r\n",
      "Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor\r\n",
      "to consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by\r\n",
      "the will of Jove fell both Danaans and Trojans. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head\r\n",
      "and covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see\r\n",
      "that he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears\r\n",
      "from his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering\r\n",
      "to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further,\r\n",
      "for they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle\r\n",
      "over his head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except\r\n",
      "Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that\r\n",
      "he was heaving. So he at once said, \"Aldermen and town councillors\r\n",
      "of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast, and\r\n",
      "of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore\r\n",
      "to the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home may be\r\n",
      "able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as\r\n",
      "boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A\r\n",
      "servant hung Demodocus's lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the\r\n",
      "cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the\r\n",
      "chief men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd\r\n",
      "of several thousands of people followed them, and there were many\r\n",
      "excellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus,\r\n",
      "Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus,\r\n",
      "and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus\r\n",
      "son of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking\r\n",
      "man among the Phaecians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas,\r\n",
      "Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the\r\n",
      "starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew\r\n",
      "forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way;\r\n",
      "he left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that\r\n",
      "a couple of mules can plough in a fallow field. They then turned to\r\n",
      "the painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best\r\n",
      "man. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing\r\n",
      "the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous's\r\n",
      "son Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said,\r\n",
      "when they had all been diverted with the games, \"Let us ask the stranger\r\n",
      "whether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully\r\n",
      "built; his thighs, claves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength,\r\n",
      "nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is\r\n",
      "nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no matter how strong\r\n",
      "he is.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are quite right, Laodamas,\" replied Euryalus, \"go up to your\r\n",
      "guest and speak to him about it yourself.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd\r\n",
      "and said to Ulysses, \"I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for\r\n",
      "some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of\r\n",
      "them- and you must have gone in for many a one before now. There is\r\n",
      "nothing that does any one so much credit all his life long as the\r\n",
      "showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try therefore\r\n",
      "at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your return home\r\n",
      "will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water,\r\n",
      "and the crew is found.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses answered, \"Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind\r\n",
      "is set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite\r\n",
      "trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king\r\n",
      "and people to further me on my return home.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Euryalus reviled him outright and said, \"I gather, then, that\r\n",
      "you are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight\r\n",
      "in. I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about\r\n",
      "in ships as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of\r\n",
      "their outward freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to\r\n",
      "be much of the athlete about you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For shame, Sir,\" answered Ulysses, fiercely, \"you are an insolent\r\n",
      "fellow- so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in\r\n",
      "speech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence,\r\n",
      "but heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he\r\n",
      "charms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his\r\n",
      "hearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows,\r\n",
      "and wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome\r\n",
      "as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion. This\r\n",
      "is your case. No god could make a finer looking fellow than you are,\r\n",
      "but you are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly\r\n",
      "angry, and you are quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic\r\n",
      "exercises; indeed, so long as I had youth and strength, I was among\r\n",
      "the first athletes of the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labour\r\n",
      "and sorrow, for I have gone through much both on the field of battle\r\n",
      "and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will\r\n",
      "compete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,\r\n",
      "larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians\r\n",
      "when disc-throwing among themselves. Then, swinging it back, he threw\r\n",
      "it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as\r\n",
      "he did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight\r\n",
      "as it sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that\r\n",
      "had been made yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked\r\n",
      "the place where it had fallen. \"A blind man, Sir,\" said she, \"could\r\n",
      "easily tell your mark by groping for it- it is so far ahead of any\r\n",
      "other. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian\r\n",
      "can come near to such a throw as yours.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,\r\n",
      "so he began to speak more pleasantly. \"Young men,\" said he, \"come\r\n",
      "up to that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy\r\n",
      "or even heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come\r\n",
      "on, for I am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do\r\n",
      "not care what it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but\r\n",
      "not with him because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one's\r\n",
      "own personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible\r\n",
      "thing for a guest to challenge his host's family at any game, especially\r\n",
      "when he is in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under\r\n",
      "his own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards any one\r\n",
      "else, for I want to have the matter out and know which is the best\r\n",
      "man. I am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport known among\r\n",
      "mankind. I am an excellent archer. In battle I am always the first\r\n",
      "to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more are taking\r\n",
      "aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man who could\r\n",
      "shoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy and in\r\n",
      "practice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of those\r\n",
      "who still eat bread upon the face of the earth, but I should not like\r\n",
      "to shoot against the mighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus the\r\n",
      "Cechalian-men who could shoot against the gods themselves. This in\r\n",
      "fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his end, for Apollo was angry\r\n",
      "with him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer. I\r\n",
      "can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow. Running\r\n",
      "is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the Phaecians\r\n",
      "might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea; my provisions\r\n",
      "ran short, and therefore I am still weak.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, \"Sir, we\r\n",
      "have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from\r\n",
      "which I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having\r\n",
      "been displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to\r\n",
      "you by one of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered\r\n",
      "by any one who knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend\r\n",
      "my meaning, and will explain to any be one of your chief men who may\r\n",
      "be dining with yourself and your family when you get home, that we\r\n",
      "have an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are\r\n",
      "not particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers,\r\n",
      "but we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We\r\n",
      "are extremely fond of good dinners, music, and dancing; we also like\r\n",
      "frequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds, so now, please,\r\n",
      "some of you who are the best dancers set about dancing, that our guest\r\n",
      "on his return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass\r\n",
      "all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, minstrels. Demodocus\r\n",
      "has left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of you and\r\n",
      "fetch it for him.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king's house,\r\n",
      "and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It\r\n",
      "was their business to manage everything connected with the sports,\r\n",
      "so they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.\r\n",
      "Presently the servant came back with Demodocus's lyre, and he took\r\n",
      "his place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in\r\n",
      "the town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was delighted\r\n",
      "with the merry twinkling of their feet. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and\r\n",
      "how they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made\r\n",
      "Venus many presents, and defiled King Vulcan's marriage bed, so the\r\n",
      "sun, who saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry\r\n",
      "when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding\r\n",
      "mischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some\r\n",
      "chains which none could either unloose or break, so that they might\r\n",
      "stay there in that place. When he had finished his snare he went into\r\n",
      "his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like\r\n",
      "cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling.\r\n",
      "Not even a god could see them, so fine and subtle were they. As soon\r\n",
      "as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he\r\n",
      "were setting out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of all places\r\n",
      "in the world was the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept no blind\r\n",
      "look out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to his house,\r\n",
      "burning with love for Venus. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was\r\n",
      "about sitting down when Mars came inside the house, an said as he\r\n",
      "took her hand in his own, \"Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is\r\n",
      "not at home, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech\r\n",
      "is barbarous.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest,\r\n",
      "whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread\r\n",
      "for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found\r\n",
      "too late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for\r\n",
      "he had turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun\r\n",
      "told him what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood\r\n",
      "in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the\r\n",
      "gods. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Father Jove,\" he cried, \"and all you other blessed gods who live\r\n",
      "for ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that\r\n",
      "I will show you. Jove's daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because\r\n",
      "I am lame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and clean built,\r\n",
      "whereas I am a cripple- but my parents are to blame for that, not\r\n",
      "I; they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together\r\n",
      "asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them. They are very\r\n",
      "fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there longer\r\n",
      "than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there,\r\n",
      "however, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave\r\n",
      "him for his baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling\r\n",
      "Neptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but\r\n",
      "the goddesses stayed at home all of them for shame. Then the givers\r\n",
      "of all good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared\r\n",
      "with inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had\r\n",
      "been, whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how\r\n",
      "limping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest\r\n",
      "god in heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, \"Messenger\r\n",
      "Mercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains\r\n",
      "were, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"King Apollo,\" answered Mercury, \"I only wish I might get the chance,\r\n",
      "though there were three times as many chains- and you might look on,\r\n",
      "all of you, gods and goddesses, but would sleep with her if I could.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune\r\n",
      "took it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free\r\n",
      "again. \"Let him go,\" he cried, \"and I will undertake, as you require,\r\n",
      "that he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among\r\n",
      "the immortal gods.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do not,\" replied Vulcan, \"ask me to do this; a bad man's bond is\r\n",
      "bad security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should\r\n",
      "go away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Vulcan,\" said Neptune, \"if Mars goes away without paying his damages,\r\n",
      "I will pay you myself.\" So Vulcan answered, \"In this case I cannot\r\n",
      "and must not refuse you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were\r\n",
      "free they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus\r\n",
      "to Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant\r\n",
      "with burnt offerings. Here the Graces hathed her, and anointed her\r\n",
      "with oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they\r\n",
      "clothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians\r\n",
      "were charmed as they heard him. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was\r\n",
      "no one to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus\r\n",
      "had made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw\r\n",
      "it up towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground\r\n",
      "and caught it with ease before it came down again. When they had done\r\n",
      "throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance, and\r\n",
      "at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one\r\n",
      "another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a\r\n",
      "great stamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in\r\n",
      "the world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was\r\n",
      "astonished as I saw them.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaecians \"Aldermen\r\n",
      "and town councillors, our guest seems to be a person of singular judgement;\r\n",
      "let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably\r\n",
      "expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and counting myself\r\n",
      "there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean cloak, a shirt,\r\n",
      "and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in a lump down\r\n",
      "at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with a light\r\n",
      "heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\r\n",
      "present too, for he has been rude.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and\r\n",
      "sent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, \"King\r\n",
      "Alcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require.\r\n",
      "He shall have sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is\r\n",
      "of silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into\r\n",
      "which it fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said,\r\n",
      "\"Good luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss\r\n",
      "may the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe\r\n",
      "return, for I understand you have been long away from home, and have\r\n",
      "gone through much hardship.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To which Ulysses answered, \"Good luck to you too my friend, and may\r\n",
      "the gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword\r\n",
      "you have given me along with your apology.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards\r\n",
      "sundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants\r\n",
      "of the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here\r\n",
      "his sons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge.\r\n",
      "Then Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their\r\n",
      "seats. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wife,\" said he, turning to Queen Arete, \"Go, fetch the best chest\r\n",
      "we have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper\r\n",
      "on the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath;\r\n",
      "see also to the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians\r\n",
      "have made him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing\r\n",
      "that will follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet- which\r\n",
      "is of exquisite workmanship- that he may be reminded of me for the\r\n",
      "rest of his life whenever he makes a drink-offering to Jove, or to\r\n",
      "any of the gods.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast\r\n",
      "as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to\r\n",
      "a clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water\r\n",
      "became hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. Meanwhile\r\n",
      "Arete brought a magnificent chest her own room, and inside it she\r\n",
      "packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians\r\n",
      "had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from Alcinous,\r\n",
      "and said to Ulysses: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once,\r\n",
      "for fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in\r\n",
      "your ship.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast\r\n",
      "with a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper\r\n",
      "servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very\r\n",
      "glad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since\r\n",
      "he left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her\r\n",
      "had taken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the\r\n",
      "servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had given\r\n",
      "him a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the\r\n",

      "rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice;\r\n",
      "while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation\r\n",

      "would not obey me, so they stayed there drinking much wine and killing\r\n",
      "great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Cicons\r\n",
      "cried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were more\r\n",
      "in number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of\r\n",
      "war, for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the\r\n",
      "occasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as\r\n",
      "leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us,\r\n",
      "so that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the\r\n",
      "ships, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another.\r\n",
      "So long as the day waxed and it was still morning, we held our own\r\n",
      "against them, though they were more in number than we; but as the\r\n",

      "us till it blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick\r\n",
      "clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships\r\n",
      "run before the gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters,\r\n",
      "so we took them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest\r\n",
      "towards the land. There we lay two days and two nights suffering much\r\n",
      "alike from toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of the third\r\n",
      "day we again raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting\r\n",

      "to take in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the\r\n",
      "shore near the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of\r\n",
      "my company to see what manner of men the people of the place might\r\n",
      "be, and they had a third man under them. They started at once, and\r\n",

      "them to eat of the lotus, which was so delicious that those who ate\r\n",
      "of it left off caring about home, and did not even want to go back\r\n",

      "nor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley,\r\n",
      "and grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild\r\n",
      "grapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They\r\n",
      "have no laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the\r\n",

      "overrun with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are\r\n",
      "never disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen- who as a rule will\r\n",
      "suffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices- do\r\n",
      "not go there, nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it\r\n",
      "lies a wilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no\r\n",

      "nor yet shipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot therefore\r\n",
      "go from city to city, or sail over the sea to one another's country\r\n",
      "as people who have ships can do; if they had had these they would\r\n",
      "have colonized the island, for it is a very good one, and would yield\r\n",
      "everything in due season. There are meadows that in some places come\r\n",
      "right down to the sea shore, well watered and full of luscious grass;\r\n",
      "grapes would do there excellently; there is level land for ploughing,\r\n",
      "and it would always yield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is\r\n",
      "deep. There is a good harbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet\r\n",
      "anchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has to do is to beach\r\n",
      "one's vessel and stay there till the wind becomes fair for putting\r\n",
      "out to sea again. At the head of the harbour there is a spring of\r\n",
      "clear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplars growing all\r\n",
      "round it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have\r\n",
      "brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick\r\n",
      "mist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass of\r\n",
      "clouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked\r\n",
      "for it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore\r\n",
      "before we found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we\r\n",

      "On this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships,\r\n",
      "and dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats.\r\n",
      "Heaven sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each\r\n",
      "ship got nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong\r\n",
      "day to the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill,- and we\r\n",
      "had plenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full\r\n",
      "when we sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out.\r\n",
      "While we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of\r\n",
      "the Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble\r\n",
      "fires. We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating\r\n",
      "of their sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on\r\n",
      "dark, we camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council.\r\n",

      "When we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of\r\n",
      "a cliff near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It\r\n",
      "was a station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there\r\n",
      "was a large yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built into\r\n",

      "to one of wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was so\r\n",
      "exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from drinking. I filled\r\n",
      "a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet full of provisions\r\n",
      "with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to deal with some\r\n",
      "savage who would be of great strength, and would respect neither right\r\n",

      "upon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus has\r\n",
      "six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry the daughters,\r\n",
      "and they all live with their dear father and mother, feasting and\r\n",
      "enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the atmosphere\r\n",

      "again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well-made bedsteads,\r\n",

      "must go, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of\r\n",
      "difficulty, but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me\r\n",
      "a prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut\r\n",
      "up in the hide as in a sack- for Jove had made him captain over the\r\n",
      "winds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his\r\n",
      "own pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly\r\n",
      "with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow\r\n",

      "river, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck\r\n",
      "him in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went\r\n",
      "clean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life\r\n",
      "went out of him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the\r\n",

      "nothing to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies\r\n",
      "and set a captain over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while\r\n",

      "they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked\r\n",
      "at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours\r\n",
      "as no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued\r\n",

      "and promised that he should do so; but now they have brought him in\r\n",
      "a ship fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him\r\n",
      "with more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he\r\n",
      "would ever have brought back from Troy, if he had had his share of\r\n",
      "the spoil and got home without misadventure.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Jove answered, \"What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking\r\n",
      "about? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would\r\n",
      "be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are.\r\n",
      "As regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence\r\n",
      "and treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself\r\n",

      "\"My good friend,\" answered Jove, \"I should recommend you at the very\r\n",
      "moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her\r\n",
      "way, to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship.\r\n",
      "This will astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under\r\n",
      "the mountain.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where\r\n",
      "the Phaecians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making\r\n",
      "rapid way, had got close-in. Then he went up to it, turned it into\r\n",
      "stone, and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it\r\n",
      "in the ground. After this he went away. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous\r\n",
      "said, \"I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that\r\n",
      "Neptune would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over\r\n",
      "the sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning\r\n",
      "from an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain. This was\r\n",
      "what my old father used to say, and now it is all coming true. Now\r\n",
      "therefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave\r\n",
      "off giving people escorts when they come here, and in the next let\r\n",
      "us sacrifice twelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy\r\n",
      "upon us, and not bury our city under the high mountain.\" When the\r\n",
      "people heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaecians to king Neptune, standing\r\n",
      "round his altar; and at the same time Ulysses woke up once more upon\r\n",
      "his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again;\r\n",
      "moreover, Jove's daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so that\r\n",
      "people might not know of his having come, and that she might tell\r\n",
      "him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and\r\n",
      "friends recognizing him until he had taken his revenge upon the wicked\r\n",
      "suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him- the\r\n",
      "long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the goodly\r\n",
      "trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native\r\n",
      "land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried\r\n",
      "aloud despairingly. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alas,\" he exclaimed, \"among what manner of people am I fallen? Are\r\n",
      "they savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane? Where shall\r\n",
      "I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had stayed\r\n",
      "over there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other\r\n",
      "great chief who would have been good to me and given me an escort.\r\n",
      "As it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave\r\n",
      "it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good truth\r\n",
      "the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly\r\n",
      "by me, and have left me in the wrong country; they said they would\r\n",
      "take me back to Ithaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector\r\n",
      "of suppliants chastise them, for he watches over everybody and punishes\r\n",
      "those who do wrong. Still, I suppose I must count my goods and see\r\n",
      "if the crew have gone off with any of them.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his\r\n",
      "clothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about\r\n",
      "not being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore\r\n",
      "of the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up\r\n",
      "to him disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien,\r\n",
      "with a good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals\r\n",
      "on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad\r\n",
      "when he saw her, and went straight up to her. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My friend,\" said he, \"you are the first person whom I have met with\r\n",
      "in this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be will disposed\r\n",
      "towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace\r\n",
      "your knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell me, then,\r\n",
      "and tell me truly, what land and country is this? Who are its inhabitants?\r\n",

      "Minerva answered, \"Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have\r\n",
      "come from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this\r\n",
      "is. It is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and\r\n",
      "West. It is rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no\r\n",
      "means a bid island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity\r\n",
      "of corn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it\r\n",
      "breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there\r\n",
      "are watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name\r\n",
      "of Ithaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a\r\n",

      "left as much more behind me for my children, but am flying because\r\n",
      "I killed Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete.\r\n",
      "I killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from\r\n",
      "Troy with so much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and\r\n",
      "by the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served his father\r\n",
      "loyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent\r\n",
      "ruler, so I lay in wait for him and with one of my followers by the\r\n",
      "road side, and speared him as he was coming into town from the country.\r\n",
      "my It was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore,\r\n",
      "that I had killed him, but as soon as I had done so I went to a ship\r\n",
      "and besought the owners, who were Phoenicians, to take me on board\r\n",
      "and set me in Pylos or in Elis where the Epeans rule, giving them\r\n",
      "as much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile, but the wind\r\n",
      "drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither\r\n",
      "by night. It was all we could do to get inside the harbour, and none\r\n",
      "of us said a word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all\r\n",
      "went on shore and lay down just as we were. I was very tired and fell\r\n",
      "asleep directly, so they took my goods out of the ship, and placed\r\n",

      "or day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming\r\n",

      "the land, and you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven\r\n",
      "of the old merman Phorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at\r\n",
      "the head of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;] here too\r\n",
      "is the overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable\r\n",

      "As she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared.\r\n",

      "where they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it\r\n",
      "all.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding\r\n",
      "places, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze,\r\n",
      "and good clothing which the Phaecians had given him. They stowed everything\r\n",
      "carefully away, and Minerva set a stone against the door of the cave.\r\n",

      "presents to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving\r\n",

      "you had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall\r\n",
      "best avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my\r\n",
      "heart as on the day when we loosed Troy's fair diadem from her brow.\r\n",

      "you, goddess, will be with me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Trust me for that,\" said she, \"I will not lose sight of you when\r\n",

      "devouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their\r\n",
      "blood and brains. I will begin by disguising you so that no human\r\n",

      "you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors,\r\n",
      "of your wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Then go at\r\n",
      "once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been always\r\n",
      "well affected towards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son;\r\n",
      "you will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is called Raven\r\n",
      "by the fountain Arethusa, where they are fattening on beechmast and\r\n",
      "spring water after their manner. Stay with him and find out how things\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"But why,\" said Ulysses, \"did you not tell him, for you knew all about\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Minerva answered, \"Never mind about him, I sent him that he might\r\n",

      "but is staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded\r\n",
      "with abundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and\r\n",
      "are lying in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can\r\n",
      "get home. I do not much think they will succeed, but rather that some\r\n",

      "themselves.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with\r\n",
      "wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over\r\n",
      "his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine\r\n",
      "ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about\r\n",
      "him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also\r\n",
      "gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished\r\n",
      "him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for\r\n",
      "him to sling it over his shoulder. \r\n",

      "things that most men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing\r\n",

      "to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command\r\n",
      "of men and ships on foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I\r\n",

      "was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily\r\n",
      "with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea\r\n",
      "of making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned\r\n",

      "when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till\r\n",

      "I wish I had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much\r\n",
      "sorrow in store for me- I took off my helmet and shield and dropped\r\n",
      "my spear from my hand; then I went straight up to the king's chariot,\r\n",
      "clasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade\r\n",

      "rascal, who had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this\r\n",
      "man talked me over into going with him to Phoenicia, where his house\r\n",
      "and his possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months,\r\n",
      "but at the end of that time when months and days had gone by till\r\n",
      "the same season had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound\r\n",

      "to that place, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take\r\n",

      "could see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our\r\n",
      "ship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his\r\n",
      "thunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was filled with\r\n",
      "fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all into\r\n",
      "the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking\r\n",
      "like so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all\r\n",
      "chance of getting home again. I was all dismayed; Jove, however, sent\r\n",
      "the ship's mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung\r\n",
      "to it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift\r\n",
      "but in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on to\r\n",

      "me hospitably without charging me anything at all for his son found\r\n",
      "me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised\r\n",

      "after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in\r\n",

      "in his own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side,\r\n",
      "and the crew found, that should take him to his own country. He sent\r\n",

      "them into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses\r\n",
      "might return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of\r\n",
      "oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and\r\n",
      "stunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they\r\n",
      "cut it up, and Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint\r\n",
      "on to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid\r\n",
      "upon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces\r\n",
      "upon the spits and roasted them till they were done; when they had\r\n",
      "taken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser in a heap.\r\n",
      "The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood up to give\r\n",
      "every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he set apart\r\n",
      "for Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he\r\n",
      "did so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses\r\n",
      "some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour,\r\n",
      "and Ulysses was much pleased. \"I hope, Eumaeus,\" said he, \"that Jove\r\n",
      "will be as well disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you\r\n",
      "are showing to an outcast like myself.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Eat, my good fellow, and\r\n",
      "enjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,\r\n",
      "just as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice\r\n",
      "to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put the\r\n",
      "cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulius\r\n",
      "brought them their bread; the swineherd had bought this man on his\r\n",
      "own account from among the Taphians during his master's absence, and\r\n",
      "had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either\r\n",
      "to his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good\r\n",
      "things that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat\r\n",
      "and drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they\r\n",
      "all went to bed after having made a hearty supper. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon.\r\n",
      "It poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West,\r\n",
      "which is a wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus,\r\n",
      "in the excellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak\r\n",
      "and give it him, or make one of his men give him one. \"Listen to me,\"\r\n",
      "said he, \"Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I\r\n",
      "will tell you something. It is the wine that makes me talk in this\r\n",
      "way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing; it will make\r\n",
      "him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had better leave\r\n",
      "unspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were\r\n",
      "still young and strong as when we got up an ambuscade before Troy.\r\n",
      "Menelaus and Ulysses were the leaders, but I was in command also,\r\n",
      "for the other two would have it so. When we had come up to the wall\r\n",
      "of the city we crouched down beneath our armour and lay there under\r\n",
      "cover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew about the swamp.\r\n",
      "It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell small\r\n",
      "and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick with rime.\r\n",
      "The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough\r\n",
      "with their shields about their shoulders, but I had carelessly left\r\n",
      "my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be too cold, and had\r\n",
      "gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds\r\n",
      "through and the stars had shifted their their places, I nudged Ulysses\r\n",
      "who was close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me his ear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Ulysses,' said I, 'this cold will be the death of me, for I have\r\n",
      "no cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but\r\n",
      "my shirt, and I do not know what to do.' \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"'Keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hear you.'\r\n",
      "Then he raised his head on his elbow. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'My friends,' said he, 'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep.\r\n",
      "We are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and\r\n",
      "tell Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.' \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running\r\n",
      "to the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough\r\n",
      "till morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in\r\n",
      "those days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak\r\n",
      "both out of good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier;\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And Eumaeus answered, \"Old man, you have told us an excellent story,\r\n",
      "and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the\r\n",
      "present, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else\r\n",
      "that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning\r\n",
      "you have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for we\r\n",
      "have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has only\r\n",
      "one. When Ulysses' son comes home again he will give you both cloak\r\n",
      "and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some goatskins\r\n",
      "and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here Ulysses lay\r\n",
      "down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he\r\n",
      "kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the\r\n",
      "swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready\r\n",
      "to go and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his property\r\n",
      "during his master's absence. First he slung his sword over his brawny\r\n",

      "the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of attack\r\n",

      "them, and never give another thought to the children of their first\r\n",
      "husband, nor to their father either when he is dead and done with.\r\n",
      "Go home, therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable\r\n",
      "woman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to send\r\n",
      "you a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of another matter which\r\n",
      "you had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors are lying\r\n",
      "in wait for you in the Strait between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean\r\n",
      "to kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will\r\n",
      "succeed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up\r\n",
      "your property will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and\r\n",
      "keep your ship well away from the islands; the god who watches over\r\n",
      "you and protects you will send you a fair wind. As soon as you get\r\n",
      "to Ithaca send your ship and men on to the town, but yourself go straight\r\n",
      "to the swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is well disposed towards\r\n",
      "you, stay with him, therefore, for the night, and then send him to\r\n",
      "Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from Pylos.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus\r\n",

      "the horses to the chariot, for we must set off home.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Pisistratus said, \"No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive\r\n",

      "his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good-bye\r\n",

      "a host who has shown him kindness.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,\r\n",
      "leaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he\r\n",
      "put on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his\r\n",
      "shoulders, and went out to meet him. \"Menelaus,\" said he, \"let me\r\n",
      "go back now to my own country, for I want to get home.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Menelaus answered, \"Telemachus, if you insist on going I will\r\n",
      "not detain you. not like to see a host either too fond of his guest\r\n",
      "or too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting\r\n",
      "a man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if\r\n",

      "till I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till\r\n",
      "you have yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient\r\n",
      "dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once\r\n",
      "more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting\r\n",
      "out on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making\r\n",
      "a tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and\r\n",
      "will conduct you myself through all our principal cities. No one will\r\n",
      "send us away empty handed; every one will give us something- a bronze\r\n",
      "tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Menelaus,\" replied Telemachus, \"I want to go home at once, for when\r\n",
      "I came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while\r\n",
      "looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something\r\n",
      "valuable has been stolen during my absence.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants\r\n",

      "At this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had\r\n",
      "just got up; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook some\r\n",
      "meat, which he at once did. Then Menelaus went down into his fragrant\r\n",
      "store room, not alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When\r\n",
      "he reached the place where the treasures of his house were kept, he\r\n",
      "selected a double cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also\r\n",
      "a silver mixing-bowl. Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she\r\n",
      "kept the lovely dresses which she had made with her own hands, and\r\n",
      "took out one that was largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery;\r\n",
      "it glittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest.\r\n",
      "Then they all came back through the house again till they got to Telemachus,\r\n",
      "and Menelaus said, \"Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno,\r\n",
      "bring you safely home according to your desire. I will now present\r\n",
      "you with the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house.\r\n",
      "It is a mixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid\r\n",
      "with gold, and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians\r\n",
      "made me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while\r\n",
      "I was on my return home. I should like to give it to you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,\r\n",
      "while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl and set it before\r\n",
      "him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I too, my son,\" said she, \"have something for you as a keepsake from\r\n",
      "the hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day.\r\n",
      "Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go\r\n",
      "back rejoicing to your own country and to your home.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly.\r\n",
      "Then Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them\r\n",
      "all as he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus\r\n",
      "into the house, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid servant\r\n",
      "brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into\r\n",
      "a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean\r\n",
      "table beside them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered\r\n",
      "them many good things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved\r\n",
      "the meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes poured\r\n",
      "out the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that\r\n",
      "were before them, but as soon as they had had had enough to eat and\r\n",
      "drink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took their\r\n",
      "places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and\r\n",
      "under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus came\r\n",
      "after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they\r\n",
      "might make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood in front\r\n",
      "of the horses and pledged them, saying, \"Farewell to both of you;\r\n",
      "see that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind\r\n",
      "to me as any father could be while we Achaeans were fighting before\r\n",
      "Troy.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We will be sure, sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"to tell him everything\r\n",
      "as soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses\r\n",
      "returned when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very\r\n",
      "great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents\r\n",
      "I am taking with me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand- an eagle with\r\n",
      "a great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the\r\n",
      "farm yard- and all the men and women were running after it and shouting.\r\n",
      "It came quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands\r\n",
      "in front of the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and their\r\n",
      "hearts took comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, \"Tell me,\r\n",
      "Menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for you?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him\r\n",
      "to make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, \"I will read this\r\n",
      "matter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it\r\n",
      "will come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred\r\n",
      "and has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled\r\n",
      "far and suffered much, will return to take his revenge- if indeed\r\n",
      "he is not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"May Jove so grant it,\" replied Telemachus; \"if it should prove to\r\n",
      "be so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when\r\n",
      "I am at home.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed\r\n",
      "through the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon\r\n",
      "their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and\r\n",
      "darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles\r\n",
      "lived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus. There they passed\r\n",
      "the night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning,\r\n",
      "rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their\r\n",
      "places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and\r\n",
      "under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed\r\n",
      "his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came\r\n",
      "to Pylos, and then Telemachus said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask\r\n",
      "you. You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we\r\n",
      "are both of an age, and this journey has brought us together still\r\n",
      "more closely; do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me\r\n",
      "there, for if I go to your father's house he will try to keep me in\r\n",
      "the warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go home at once.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end\r\n",
      "he deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus's\r\n",
      "beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel.\r\n",
      "Then he said, \"Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also\r\n",
      "before I can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he\r\n",
      "is, and am sure he will not let you go; he will come down here to\r\n",
      "fetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he will be very\r\n",
      "angry.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians\r\n",
      "and soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together\r\n",
      "and gave his orders. \"Now, my men,\" said he, \"get everything in order\r\n",
      "on board the ship, and let us set out home.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But\r\n",
      "as Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva\r\n",
      "in the ship's stern, there came to him a man from a distant country,\r\n",
      "a seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He\r\n",
      "was descended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of\r\n",
      "sheep; he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into\r\n",
      "exile by the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods\r\n",
      "and held them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner\r\n",
      "in the house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on\r\n",
      "account of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a\r\n",
      "great sorrow that dread Erinyes had laid upon him. In the end, however,\r\n",
      "he escaped with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos,\r\n",
      "avenged the wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of\r\n",
      "Neleus to his brother. Then he left the country and went to Argos,\r\n",
      "where it was ordained that he should reign over much people. There\r\n",
      "he married, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates\r\n",
      "and Mantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus,\r\n",
      "who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live\r\n",
      "to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman's gifts.\r\n",
      "His sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of\r\n",

      "have great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at\r\n",

      "sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them\r\n",
      "to catch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They\r\n",
      "set the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made\r\n",
      "it fast with the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with\r\n",
      "sheets of twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew\r\n",

      "news of her husband to queen Penelope. I could then go about among\r\n",
      "the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give me\r\n",
      "a dinner. I should soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts\r\n",
      "of ways. Listen and believe when I tell you that by the blessing of\r\n",
      "Mercury who gives grace and good name to the works of all men, there\r\n",

      "well looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables are kept\r\n",
      "quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay where\r\n",
      "you are, then; you are not in anybody's way; I do not mind your being\r\n",
      "here, no more do any of the others, and when Telemachus comes home\r\n",

      "there is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp; still,\r\n",
      "when men have once got low down in the world they will go through\r\n",
      "a great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since however you\r\n",

      "about the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him\r\n",
      "more than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end through sorrow\r\n",
      "for her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me\r\n",

      "the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together, and she\r\n",
      "made little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up,\r\n",
      "they sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As\r\n",
      "for me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of\r\n",
      "sandals for my feet, and sent me off into the country, but she was\r\n",
      "just as fond of me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased\r\n",
      "heaven to prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have\r\n",
      "enough to eat and drink, and can find something for any respectable\r\n",
      "stranger who comes here; but there is no getting a kind word or deed\r\n",
      "out of my mistress, for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked\r\n",
      "people. Servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk\r\n",
      "with her; they like to have something to eat and drink at the house,\r\n",

      "nights are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for\r\n",
      "sleeping and sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed\r\n",

      "another stories about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered\r\n",
      "much, and been buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling\r\n",
      "the memory of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards your question,\r\n",
      "then, my tale is as follows: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above\r\n",
      "Ortygia, where the land begins to turn round and look in another direction.\r\n",
      "It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good, with much pasture\r\n",
      "fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine and wheat. Dearth\r\n",
      "never comes there, nor are the people plagued by any sickness, but\r\n",
      "when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them with his\r\n",
      "painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole country\r\n",
      "is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus, a\r\n",
      "man comparable to the gods, reigned over both. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia\r\n",
      "(for the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had\r\n",
      "freighted with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician\r\n",
      "woman in my father's house, very tall and comely, and an excellent\r\n",
      "servant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing\r\n",
      "near their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman\r\n",
      "can resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who had\r\n",
      "seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on\r\n",
      "this she told him her father's name. 'I come from Sidon,' said she,\r\n",
      "'and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I\r\n",
      "was coming into the town from the country some Taphian pirates seized\r\n",
      "me and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the man who\r\n",
      "owns this house, and he gave them their price for me.' \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The man who had seduced her then said, 'Would you like to come along\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"'I will do so gladly,' answered she, 'if you men will first swear\r\n",
      "me a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their\r\n",

      "street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one\r\n",
      "should go and tell my master, in which case he would suspect something.\r\n",
      "He would put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep\r\n",
      "your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can,\r\n",
      "and send me word when you have done loading. I will bring as much\r\n",
      "gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else also that\r\n",
      "I can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good\r\n",
      "man of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. I\r\n",
      "will carry him off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of\r\n",
      "money for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts.'\r\n",

      "\"On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole\r\n",
      "year till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,\r\n",
      "and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the\r\n",
      "woman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father's\r\n",
      "house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it;\r\n",
      "and while my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring\r\n",
      "it and bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and\r\n",
      "then went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led\r\n",
      "me out of the house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables\r\n",
      "set with the cups of guests who had been feasting with my father,\r\n",
      "as being in attendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting\r\n",
      "of the public assembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried\r\n",
      "them off in the bosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew\r\n",
      "no better. The sun was now set, and darkness was over all the land,\r\n",
      "so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour,\r\n",
      "where the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they\r\n",
      "sailed their ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent\r\n",
      "then a fair wind; six days did we sail both night and day, but on\r\n",
      "the seventh day Diana struck the woman and she fell heavily down into\r\n",
      "the ship's hold as though she were a sea gull alighting on the water;\r\n",
      "so they threw her overboard to the seals and fishes, and I was left\r\n",
      "all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds and waves took the ship\r\n",
      "to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and thus\r\n",
      "it was that ever I came to set eyes upon this country.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses answered, \"Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes\r\n",
      "with the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good\r\n",
      "as well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master,\r\n",
      "who sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead\r\n",
      "a good life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city\r\n",
      "to city.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left\r\n",
      "for sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the meantime Telemachus and\r\n",
      "his crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the\r\n",
      "mast, and rowed the ship into the harbour. They cast out their mooring\r\n",
      "stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,\r\n",
      "mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough\r\n",
      "to eat and drink Telemachus said, \"Take the ship on to the town, but\r\n",
      "leave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my\r\n",
      "farms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down\r\n",
      "to the city, and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"At any other time,\" replied Telemachus, \"I should have bidden you\r\n",
      "go to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at\r\n",
      "the present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for\r\n",

      "show herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in\r\n",
      "an upper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose\r\n",
      "house you can go to- I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is\r\n",
      "held in the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much\r\n",
      "the best man and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying\r\n",
      "court to my mother and trying to take Ulysses' place. Jove, however,\r\n",
      "in heaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end before\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand- a hawk, Apollo's\r\n",
      "messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore\r\n",
      "them off, fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the ship.\r\n",
      "On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.\r\n",
      "\"Telemachus,\" said he, \"that bird did not fly on your right hand without\r\n",
      "having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it\r\n",

      "will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wish it may prove so,\" answered Telemachus. \"If it does, I will\r\n",

      "who meet you will congratulate you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head\r\n",
      "of sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the\r\n",
      "hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city\r\n",
      "as they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as\r\n",
      "he could, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds\r\n",
      "of swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who\r\n",

      "\"So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When\r\n",

      "\"I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay\r\n",
      "it for me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green\r\n",
      "brushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemachus\r\n",
      "to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat,\r\n",
      "the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he filled\r\n",
      "the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine also\r\n",
      "in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they\r\n",
      "laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as\r\n",
      "soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,\r\n",
      "\"Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew\r\n",
      "bring him to Ithaca, and who were they?-for assuredly he did not come\r\n",
      "here by land\"' \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"My son, I will tell you\r\n",
      "the real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great\r\n",
      "traveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,\r\n",
      "and has refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands. Do\r\n",
      "whatever you like with him, only remember that he is your suppliant.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am very much distressed,\" said Telemachus, \"by what you have just\r\n",
      "told me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young,\r\n",
      "and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My\r\n",
      "mother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look\r\n",
      "after the house out of respect for public opinion and the memory of\r\n",
      "her husband, or whether the time is now come for her to take the best\r\n",
      "man of those who are wooing her, and the one who will make her the\r\n",
      "most advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to your station\r\n",
      "I will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals,\r\n",
      "and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can\r\n",
      "keep him here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food\r\n",
      "that he may be no burden on you and on your men; but I will not have\r\n",
      "him go near the suitors, for they are very insolent, and are sure\r\n",
      "to ill-treat him in a way that would greatly grieve me; no matter\r\n",
      "how valiant a man may be he can do nothing against numbers, for they\r\n",
      "will be too strong for him.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Ulysses said, \"Sir, it is right that I should say something myself.\r\n",
      "I am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way\r\n",
      "in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you\r\n",
      "are. Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some\r\n",
      "god set your people against you? May you not complain of your brothers-\r\n",
      "for it is to these that a man may look for support, however great\r\n",
      "his quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are and in my present\r\n",
      "mind; if I were son to Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would\r\n",
      "rather some one came and cut my head off, but I would go to the house\r\n",
      "and be the bane of every one of these men. If they were too many for\r\n",
      "me- I being single-handed- I would rather die fighting in my own house\r\n",
      "than see such disgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly\r\n",
      "maltreated, and men dragging the women servants about the house in\r\n",
      "an unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no\r\n",
      "purpose for an end that shall never be accomplished.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Telemachus answered, \"I will tell you truly everything. There\r\n",
      "is no emnity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers,\r\n",
      "to whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be.\r\n",
      "Jove has made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of\r\n",
      "Arceisius, and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son\r\n",
      "of Ulysses who left me behind him when he went away, so that I have\r\n",
      "never been of any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the\r\n",
      "hands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring\r\n",
      "islands, Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men\r\n",
      "of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying\r\n",
      "court to my mother, who will neither say point blank that she will\r\n",
      "not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, so they are making havoc\r\n",
      "of my estate, and before long will do so with myself into the bargain.\r\n",
      "The issue, however, rests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaeus,\r\n",
      "go at once and tell Penelope that I am safe and have returned from\r\n",
      "Pylos. Tell it to herself alone, and then come back here without letting\r\n",
      "any one else know, for there are many who are plotting mischief against\r\n",
      "me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I understand and heed you,\" replied Eumaeus; \"you need instruct me\r\n",
      "no further, only I am going that way say whether I had not better\r\n",
      "let poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend\r\n",
      "the work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses,\r\n",
      "and he would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they\r\n",
      "tell me that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither\r\n",
      "eaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his farm,\r\n",
      "but sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"More's the pity,\" answered Telemachus, \"I am sorry for him, but we\r\n",
      "must leave him to himself just now. If people could have everything\r\n",
      "their own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return\r\n",
      "of my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back\r\n",
      "again, and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother\r\n",
      "to send one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him\r\n",
      "hear it from her.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,\r\n",
      "bound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched\r\n",
      "him well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a\r\n",
      "woman- fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the\r\n",
      "entry, and revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see\r\n",
      "her, and knew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves\r\n",
      "be seen by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs, for they\r\n",
      "did not bark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of\r\n",
      "the yards. She nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows;\r\n",
      "whereon he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall\r\n",
      "of the yards. Then she said to him: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your\r\n",
      "son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for\r\n",
      "the destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will\r\n",
      "not be long in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw\r\n",
      "a fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him\r\n",
      "younger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,\r\n",
      "filled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she\r\n",
      "went away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded\r\n",
      "when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking\r\n",
      "upon a god. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stranger,\" said he, \"how suddenly you have changed from what you\r\n",
      "were a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour\r\n",
      "is not the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in\r\n",
      "heaven? If so, be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice\r\n",
      "and offerings of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Ulysses said, \"I am no god, why should you take me for one? I\r\n",
      "am your father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at\r\n",
      "the hands of lawless men.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to\r\n",
      "the ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. but Telemachus\r\n",
      "could not yet believe that it was his father, and said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes\r\n",
      "that I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself\r\n",
      "contrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young\r\n",
      "at a moment's notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you\r\n",
      "were old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down\r\n",
      "from heaven.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses answered, \"Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably\r\n",
      "astonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who\r\n",
      "will come hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering\r\n",
      "and much hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country.\r\n",
      "What you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva,\r\n",
      "who does with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases.\r\n",
      "At one moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young\r\n",
      "man with good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods\r\n",
      "who live in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father\r\n",
      "and wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like\r\n",
      "eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their\r\n",
      "half fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and\r\n",
      "the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had\r\n",
      "not suddenly said, \"In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring\r\n",
      "you to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be- for\r\n",
      "you cannot have come by land?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" replied Ulysses. \"It was the\r\n",
      "Phaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in\r\n",
      "the habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They\r\n",
      "took me over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca,\r\n",
      "after giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These\r\n",
      "things by heaven's mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now\r\n",
      "come here on the suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing\r\n",
      "our enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with\r\n",
      "their number, that I may learn who, and how many, they are. I can\r\n",
      "then turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether we two can fight\r\n",
      "the whole body of them ourselves, or whether we must find others to\r\n",
      "help us.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this Telemachus answered, \"Father, I have always heard of your\r\n",
      "renown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of\r\n",
      "is a very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men\r\n",
      "cannot stand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors\r\n",
      "only, nor twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their\r\n",
      "number at once. There are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium,\r\n",
      "and they have six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty\r\n",
      "young Achaeans from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all\r\n",
      "of them well born. They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and\r\n",
      "two men who can carve at table. If we face such numbers as this, you\r\n",
      "may have bitter cause to rue your coming, and your revenge. See whether\r\n",
      "you cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and help\r\n",
      "us.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Listen to me,\" replied Ulysses, \"and think whether Minerva and her\r\n",
      "father Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some\r\n",
      "one else as well.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Those whom you have named,\" answered Telemachus, \"are a couple of\r\n",
      "good allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have\r\n",
      "power over both gods and men.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"These two,\" continued Ulysses, \"will not keep long out of the fray,\r\n",
      "when the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return\r\n",
      "home early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as before.\r\n",
      "Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a miserable\r\n",
      "old beggar. If you see them ill-treating me, steel your heart against\r\n",
      "my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of the house,\r\n",
      "or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently trying\r\n",
      "to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to you,\r\n",
      "for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and\r\n",
      "lay my saying to your heart, when Minerva shall put it in my mind,\r\n",
      "I will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect\r\n",
      "all the armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store\r\n",
      "room. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing\r\n",
      "it; say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke,\r\n",
      "inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but\r\n",
      "has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly\r\n",
      "that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine,\r\n",
      "and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both\r\n",
      "banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people\r\n",
      "to use them. But leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and\r\n",
      "me, and a couple oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any\r\n",
      "moment; Jove and Minerva will then soon quiet these people. There\r\n",
      "is also another matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs\r\n",
      "in your veins, let no one know that Ulysses is within the house- neither\r\n",
      "Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even\r\n",
      "Penelope herself. Let you and me exploit the women alone, and let\r\n",
      "us also make trial of some other of the men servants, to see who is\r\n",
      "on our side and whose hand is against us.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Father,\" replied Telemachus, \"you will come to know me by and by,\r\n",
      "and when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not\r\n",
      "think, however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either\r\n",
      "of us. Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round\r\n",
      "of the farms and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will\r\n",
      "be wasting your estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove\r\n",
      "the women by all means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless,\r\n",
      "but I am not in favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend\r\n",
      "to that later on, if you really have some sign from Jove that he will\r\n",
      "support you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought Telemachus\r\n",
      "and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When they\r\n",
      "had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land; their\r\n",
      "servants came and took their armour from them, and they left all the\r\n",
      "presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant to tell\r\n",
      "Penelope that Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent the\r\n",
      "ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.\r\n",
      "This servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the\r\n",
      "same errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House,\r\n",
      "the servant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the\r\n",
      "waiting women, \"Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos\"; but\r\n",
      "Eumaeus went close up to Penelope, and said privately that her son\r\n",
      "had given bidden him tell her. When he had given his message he left\r\n",
      "the house with its outbuildings and went back to his pigs again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they\r\n",
      "went outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held\r\n",
      "a council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was\r\n",
      "the first to speak. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My friends,\" said he, \"this voyage of Telemachus's is a very serious\r\n",
      "matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however,\r\n",
      "let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send\r\n",
      "after the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and\r\n",
      "saw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails,\r\n",
      "and putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others,\r\n",
      "\"We need not send them any message, for they are here. Some god must\r\n",
      "have told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake\r\n",
      "her. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the\r\n",
      "ship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they\r\n",
      "went up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let\r\n",
      "any one old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes,\r\n",
      "spoke first. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good heavens,\" said he, \"see how the gods have saved this man from\r\n",
      "destruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all\r\n",
      "day long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep,\r\n",
      "but waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing\r\n",
      "and killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us.\r\n",
      "Let us consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape\r\n",
      "us; our affair is never likely to come off while is alive, for he\r\n",
      "is very shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our side.\r\n",
      "We must make haste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he\r\n",
      "will lose no time in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and\r\n",
      "will tell all the world how we plotted to kill him, but failed to\r\n",
      "take him. The people will not like this when they come to know of\r\n",
      "it; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from our own\r\n",
      "country into exile. Let us try and lay hold of him either on his farm\r\n",
      "away from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can divide up his\r\n",
      "property amongst us, and let his mother and the man who marries her\r\n",
      "have the house. If this does not please you, and you wish Telemachus\r\n",
      "to live on and hold his father's property, then we must not gather\r\n",
      "here and eat up his goods in this way, but must make our offers to\r\n",
      "Penelope each from his own house, and she can marry the man who will\r\n",
      "give the most for her, and whose lot it is to win her.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the\r\n",
      "son of Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among\r\n",
      "all the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of\r\n",
      "Dulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope\r\n",
      "than that of any of the other for he was a man of good natural disposition.\r\n",
      "\"My friends,\" said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly,\r\n",
      "\"I am not in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous thing to\r\n",
      "kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of the gods,\r\n",
      "and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to kill him\r\n",
      "myself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade\r\n",
      "us, I would have you hold your hands.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose forthwith\r\n",
      "and went to the house of Ulysses where they took their accustomed\r\n",
      "seats. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors.\r\n",
      "She knew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had\r\n",
      "overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore\r\n",

      "she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister\r\n",
      "holding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best\r\n",
      "speaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you\r\n",
      "are nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the\r\n",
      "death of Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness\r\n",
      "is Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one\r\n",
      "another. Do you not remember how your father fled to this house in\r\n",
      "fear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gone with\r\n",
      "some Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace\r\n",
      "with us? They wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he\r\n",
      "had, but Ulysses stayed their hands although they were infuriated,\r\n",
      "and now you devour his property without paying for it, and break my\r\n",
      "heart by his wooing his wife and trying to kill his son. Leave off\r\n",
      "doing so, and stop the others also.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, \"Take heart, Queen Penelope\r\n",
      "daughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters.\r\n",
      "The man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon\r\n",
      "your son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the\r\n",
      "earth. I say- and it shall surely be- that my spear shall be reddened\r\n",
      "with his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees,\r\n",
      "held wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands.\r\n",
      "Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing\r\n",
      "to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to\r\n",
      "him from the gods, he cannot escape it.\" He said this to quiet her,\r\n",
      "but in reality he was plotting against Telemachus. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva\r\n",
      "shed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses\r\n",
      "and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and\r\n",
      "were ready; helping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore\r\n",
      "came up to Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her\r\n",
      "wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd\r\n",
      "might recognize him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Telemachus was the first to speak. \"So you have got back, Eumaeus,\"\r\n",

      "or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I did not think of asking about that,\" replied Eumaeus, \"when I was\r\n",
      "in the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon\r\n",
      "as I could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos,\r\n",
      "and he was the first to tell the new your mother, but I can say what\r\n",
      "I saw with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill\r\n",
      "of Mercury above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with\r\n",
      "a number of men in her. They had many shields and spears, and I thought\r\n",
      "it was the suitors, but I cannot be sure.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus\r\n",
      "could not see him. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they\r\n",

      "When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus\r\n",
      "bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands,\r\n",
      "for he wanted to go into the city. \"Old friend,\" said he to the swineherd,\r\n",
      "\"I will now go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will\r\n",
      "never leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate\r\n",
      "stranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who\r\n",
      "will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough\r\n",
      "of my own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes\r\n",
      "him angry so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "always do better in town than country, for any one who likes can give\r\n",
      "him something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck\r\n",
      "and call of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told\r\n",
      "him, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire,\r\n",
      "and the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly\r\n",
      "thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you\r\n",
      "say the city is some way off.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge\r\n",
      "upon the When he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing-post\r\n",
      "of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and\r\n",
      "went inside. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting\r\n",
      "the fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up\r\n",
      "to him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and\r\n",
      "shoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking\r\n",
      "like Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son.\r\n",
      "She kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, \"Light of my\r\n",
      "eyes,\" she cried as she spoke fondly to him, \"so you are come home\r\n",
      "again; I made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think\r\n",
      "of your having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it\r\n",
      "or obtaining my consent. But come, tell me what you saw.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do not scold me, mother,' answered Telemachus, \"nor vex me, seeing\r\n",
      "what a narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change your dress,\r\n",
      "go upstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs\r\n",
      "to all the gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors.\r\n",
      "I must now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has\r\n",
      "come back with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew, and told\r\n",
      "Piraeus to take him home and look after him till I could come for\r\n",
      "him myself.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She heeded her son's words, washed her face, changed her dress, and\r\n",
      "vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would\r\n",
      "only vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Telemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand-\r\n",
      "not alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him\r\n",
      "with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him\r\n",
      "as he went by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words\r\n",
      "in their mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and\r\n",
      "went to sit with Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of\r\n",
      "his father's house, and they made him tell them all that had happened\r\n",
      "to him. Then Piraeus came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted\r\n",
      "through the town to the place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once\r\n",
      "joined them. Piraeus was first to speak: \"Telemachus,\" said he, \"I\r\n",
      "wish you would send some of your women to my house to take awa the\r\n",
      "presents Menelaus gave you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We do not know, Piraeus,\" answered Telemachus, \"what may happen.\r\n",
      "If the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among\r\n",
      "them, I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people\r\n",
      "should get hold of them. If on the other hand I manage to kill them,\r\n",
      "I shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they\r\n",
      "got there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into\r\n",
      "the baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed\r\n",
      "them, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats\r\n",
      "at table. A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden\r\n",
      "ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands;\r\n",
      "and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them\r\n",
      "bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.\r\n",
      "Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the bearing-posts\r\n",
      "of the cloister, and spinning. Then they laid their hands on the good\r\n",
      "things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to\r\n",
      "eat and drink Penelope said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which\r\n",
      "I have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set\r\n",
      "out for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make\r\n",
      "it clear to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether\r\n",
      "or no you had been able to hear anything about the return of your\r\n",
      "father.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will tell you then truth,\" replied her son. \"We went to Pylos and\r\n",
      "saw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably\r\n",
      "as though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long\r\n",
      "absence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word\r\n",
      "from any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead.\r\n",
      "He sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There\r\n",
      "I saw Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were\r\n",
      "in heaven's wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was\r\n",
      "that had brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth,\r\n",
      "whereon he said, 'So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man's\r\n",
      "bed? A hind might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a\r\n",
      "lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell.\r\n",
      "The lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work with\r\n",
      "the pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father\r\n",
      "Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was\r\n",
      "when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily\r\n",
      "that all the Greeks cheered him- if he is still such, and were to\r\n",
      "come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry\r\n",
      "wedding. As regards your question, however, I will not prevaricate\r\n",
      "nor deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much\r\n",
      "will I tell you in full. He said he could see Ulysses on an island\r\n",
      "sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was keeping\r\n",
      "him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no ships\r\n",
      "nor sailors to take him over the sea.' This was what Menelaus told\r\n",
      "me, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave\r\n",
      "me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus\r\n",
      "said to her: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things;\r\n",
      "listen therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide\r\n",
      "nothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the\r\n",
      "rites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come,\r\n",
      "that Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about\r\n",
      "the country or staying in one place, is enquiring into all these evil\r\n",
      "deeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen\r\n",
      "when I was on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemachus about\r\n",
      "it.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true,\r\n",
      "you shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who\r\n",
      "see you shall congratulate you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs,\r\n",
      "or aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of\r\n",
      "the house, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it\r\n",
      "was now time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come\r\n",
      "into the town from all the country round, with their shepherds as\r\n",
      "usual, then Medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited\r\n",
      "upon them at table, said, \"Now then, my young masters, you have had\r\n",
      "enough sport, so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner\r\n",
      "is not a bad thing, at dinner time.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They left their sports as he told them, and when they were within\r\n",
      "the house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside,\r\n",
      "and then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of\r\n",
      "them fat and well grown. Thus they made ready for their meal. In the\r\n",
      "meantime Ulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town,\r\n",
      "and the swineherd said, \"Stranger, I suppose you still want to go\r\n",
      "to town to-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part\r\n",
      "I should have liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must\r\n",
      "do as my master tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding\r\n",
      "from one's master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for\r\n",
      "it is now broad day; it will be night again directly and then you\r\n",
      "will find it colder.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know, and understand you,\" replied Ulysses; \"you need say no more.\r\n",
      "Let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it\r\n",
      "to walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders,\r\n",
      "by the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his\r\n",
      "liking. The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the\r\n",
      "dogs and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and\r\n",
      "his master followed after, looking like some broken-down old tramp\r\n",
      "as he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When\r\n",
      "they had got over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city,\r\n",
      "they reached the fountain from which the citizens drew their water.\r\n",
      "This had been made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was a\r\n",
      "grove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and\r\n",
      "the clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, while above\r\n",
      "the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers\r\n",
      "used to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as\r\n",
      "he was driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors'\r\n",
      "dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus\r\n",
      "and Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language,\r\n",
      "which made Ulysses very angry. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There you go,\" cried he, \"and a precious pair you are. See how heaven\r\n",
      "brings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray, master\r\n",
      "swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make\r\n",
      "any one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never\r\n",
      "won a prize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his\r\n",
      "shoulders against every man's door post, and begging, not for swords\r\n",
      "and cauldrons like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth begging\r\n",
      "for. If you would give him to me for a hand on my station, he might\r\n",
      "do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids,\r\n",
      "and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but\r\n",
      "he has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind of work; he\r\n",
      "will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over, to feed his insatiable\r\n",
      "belly. I say, therefore and it shall surely be- if he goes near Ulysses'\r\n",
      "house he will get his head broken by the stools they will fling at\r\n",
      "him, till they turn him out.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure\r\n",
      "wantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path.\r\n",
      "For a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill\r\n",
      "him with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains\r\n",
      "out; he resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check,\r\n",
      "but the swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting\r\n",
      "up his hands and praying to heaven as he did so. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fountain nymphs,\" he cried, \"children of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned\r\n",
      "you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my\r\n",
      "prayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to\r\n",
      "the swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting\r\n",
      "people-gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin\r\n",
      "through bad shepherding.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Melanthius the goatherd answered, \"You ill-conditioned cur, what\r\n",
      "are you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship\r\n",
      "and take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket\r\n",
      "the money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would\r\n",
      "strike Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill\r\n",
      "him, as I am that Ulysses will never come home again.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went\r\n",
      "quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he\r\n",
      "got there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite\r\n",
      "Eurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. The servants\r\n",
      "brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread\r\n",
      "before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd\r\n",
      "came up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemius\r\n",
      "was just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold\r\n",
      "of the swineherd's hand, and said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how\r\n",
      "far you go you will find few like it. One building keeps following\r\n",
      "on after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all\r\n",
      "round it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it\r\n",
      "would be a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too,\r\n",
      "that there are many people banqueting within it, for there is a smell\r\n",
      "of roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods have made\r\n",
      "to go along with feasting.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Eumaeus said, \"You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally\r\n",
      "do; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside\r\n",
      "first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you\r\n",
      "wait here and let me go in first? But do not wait long, or some one\r\n",
      "may you loitering about outside, and throw something at you. Consider\r\n",
      "this matter I pray you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Ulysses answered, \"I understand and heed. Go in first and leave\r\n",
      "me here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things\r\n",
      "thrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea\r\n",
      "that I am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a\r\n",
      "man cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy\r\n",
      "which gives much trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships\r\n",
      "are fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war upon other people.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised\r\n",
      "his head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had\r\n",
      "bred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out\r\n",
      "of him. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when\r\n",
      "they went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his\r\n",
      "master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow\r\n",
      "dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come\r\n",
      "and draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of fleas.\r\n",
      "As soon as he saw Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears and\r\n",
      "wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. When\r\n",
      "Ulysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear from\r\n",
      "his eyes without Eumaeus seeing it, and said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:\r\n",
      "his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he\r\n",
      "only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept\r\n",
      "merely for show?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This hound,\" answered Eumaeus, \"belonged to him who has died in a\r\n",
      "far country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he\r\n",
      "would soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in\r\n",
      "the forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks.\r\n",
      "But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone,\r\n",
      "and the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when\r\n",
      "their master's hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes half the\r\n",
      "goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the\r\n",
      "suitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognized his master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Telemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned\r\n",
      "him to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat\r\n",
      "lying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the\r\n",
      "suitors; he picked it up, brought it to Telemachus's table, and sat\r\n",
      "down opposite him. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave\r\n",
      "him bread from the bread-basket. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Immediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor miserable\r\n",
      "old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags.\r\n",
      "He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading\r\n",
      "from the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood\r\n",
      "which the carpenter had skillfully planed, and had made to join truly\r\n",
      "with rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the bread-basket,\r\n",
      "with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and said to Eumaeus,\r\n",
      "\"Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round of the suitors,\r\n",
      "and beg from them; a beggar must not be shamefaced.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So Eumaeus went up to him and said, \"Stranger, Telemachus sends you\r\n",
      "this, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for\r\n",
      "beggars must not be shamefaced.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses answered, \"May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus,\r\n",
      "and fulfil the desire of his heart.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid\r\n",
      "it on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while\r\n",
      "the bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left\r\n",
      "off. The suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses\r\n",
      "and prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors,\r\n",
      "that he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good\r\n",
      "from the bad; but come what might she was not going to save a single\r\n",
      "one of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left\r\n",
      "to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real\r\n",
      "beggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking\r\n",
      "one another who he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd\r\n",
      "Melanthius said, \"Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something\r\n",
      "about him, for I have seen him before. The swineherd brought him here,\r\n",
      "but I know nothing about the man himself, nor where he comes from.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. \"You precious idiot,\"\r\n",
      "he cried, \"what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not\r\n",
      "tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?\r\n",
      "Do you think it a small thing that such people gather here to waste\r\n",
      "your master's property and must you needs bring this man as well?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Eumaeus answered, \"Antinous, your birth is good but your words\r\n",
      "evil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to\r\n",
      "invite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those\r\n",
      "who can do public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter,\r\n",
      "or a bard who can charm us with his Such men are welcome all the world\r\n",
      "over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him.\r\n",
      "You are always harder on Ulysses' servants than any of the other suitors\r\n",
      "are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as Telemachus\r\n",
      "and Penelope are alive and here.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Telemachus said, \"Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the bitterest\r\n",
      "tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then turning to Antinous he said, \"Antinous, you take as much care\r\n",
      "of my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to\r\n",
      "see this stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take' something\r\n",
      "and give it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never\r\n",
      "mind my mother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I\r\n",
      "know you will not do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things\r\n",
      "yourself than of giving them to other people.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean, Telemachus,\" replied Antinous, \"by this swaggering\r\n",
      "talk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would\r\n",
      "not come here again for another three months.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from\r\n",
      "under the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses,\r\n",
      "but the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet\r\n",
      "with bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold\r\n",
      "and eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to Antinous\r\n",
      "and said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here;\r\n",
      "you seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should\r\n",
      "be the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty.\r\n",
      "I too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those\r\n",
      "days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might\r\n",
      "be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other\r\n",
      "things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy,\r\n",
      "but it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band\r\n",
      "of roving robbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone\r\n",
      "by it. I stationed my bade ships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my\r\n",
      "men stay by them and keep guard over them, while sent out scouts to\r\n",
      "reconnoitre from every point of vantage. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\r\n",
      "the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives\r\n",
      "and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and\r\n",
      "when they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till\r\n",
      "the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam\r\n",
      "of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no\r\n",
      "longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians\r\n",
      "killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for\r\n",
      "them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them, to take\r\n",
      "to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man in Cyprus.\r\n",
      "Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Antinous said, \"What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague\r\n",
      "us during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court, or\r\n",
      "I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and\r\n",
      "importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given\r\n",
      "you lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to\r\n",
      "be free with other people's property when there is plenty of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this Ulysses began to move off, and said, \"Your looks, my fine\r\n",
      "sir, are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house\r\n",
      "you would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though\r\n",
      "you are in another man's, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot\r\n",
      "find it in you to give him even a piece of bread.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, \"You\r\n",
      "shall pay for this before you get clear of the court.\" With these\r\n",
      "words he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder-blade\r\n",
      "near the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow\r\n",
      "did not even stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded\r\n",
      "on his revenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there,\r\n",
      "laying his well-filled wallet at his feet. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Listen to me,\" he cried, \"you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may\r\n",
      "speak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he\r\n",
      "gets hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle;\r\n",
      "and even so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable\r\n",
      "belly, which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the\r\n",
      "poor have gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous\r\n",
      "may come to a bad end before his marriage.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off elsewhere,\"\r\n",
      "shouted Antinous. \"If you say more I will have you dragged hand and\r\n",
      "foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you alive.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young\r\n",
      "men said, \"Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a\r\n",
      "tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god-\r\n",
      "and we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people\r\n",
      "from foreign countries, and travel about the world to see who do amiss\r\n",
      "and who righteously.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile Telemachus\r\n",
      "was furious about the blow that had been given to his father, and\r\n",
      "though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence and brooded\r\n",
      "on his revenge. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the banqueting-cloister,\r\n",
      "she said before her maids, \"Would that Apollo would so strike you,\r\n",
      "Antinous,\" and her waiting woman Eurynome answered, \"If our prayers\r\n",
      "were answered not one of the suitors would ever again see the sun\r\n",
      "rise.\" Then Penelope said, \"Nurse, I hate every single one of them,\r\n",
      "for they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate Antinous like the darkness\r\n",
      "of death itself. A poor unfortunate tramp has come begging about the\r\n",
      "house for sheer want. Every one else has given him something to put\r\n",
      "in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him on the right shoulder-blade\r\n",
      "with a footstool.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in\r\n",
      "the meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the\r\n",
      "swineherd and said, \"Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here,\r\n",
      "I want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled\r\n",
      "much, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"If these Achaeans, Madam,\r\n",
      "would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his\r\n",
      "adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,\r\n",
      "which was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,\r\n",
      "and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had\r\n",
      "been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose\r\n",
      "lips all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed\r\n",
      "as I sat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship\r\n",
      "between his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete\r\n",
      "where the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither\r\n",
      "and thither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he\r\n",
      "has heard of Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the Thesprotians,\r\n",
      "and that he is bringing great wealth home with him.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Call him here, then,\" said Penelope, \"that I too may hear his story.\r\n",
      "As for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as\r\n",
      "they will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine\r\n",
      "remain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume\r\n",
      "them, while they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing\r\n",
      "our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving\r\n",
      "so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate\r\n",
      "can stand such recklessness, for we have now no Ulysses to protect\r\n",
      "us. If he were to come again, he and his son would soon have their\r\n",
      "revenge.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded\r\n",
      "with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to Eumaeus,\r\n",
      "\"Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just\r\n",
      "as I was speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are going\r\n",
      "to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore I\r\n",
      "say, and lay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger\r\n",
      "is speaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of good wear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said, \"Father\r\n",
      "stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for\r\n",
      "you; she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can\r\n",
      "tell her about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking\r\n",
      "the truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very\r\n",
      "things that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough\r\n",
      "of that to fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting\r\n",
      "those give that will.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will tell Penelope,\" answered Ulysses, \"nothing but what is strictly\r\n",
      "true. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him\r\n",
      "in affliction, but I am afraid of passing. through this crowd of cruel\r\n",
      "suitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now, moreover,\r\n",
      "as I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man gave\r\n",
      "me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any one\r\n",
      "else defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait\r\n",
      "till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my\r\n",
      "clothes are worn very thin- you know they are, for you have seen them\r\n",
      "ever since I first asked you to help me- she can then ask me about\r\n",
      "the return of her husband.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she\r\n",
      "saw him cross the threshold, \"Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus?\r\n",
      "Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming\r\n",
      "inside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"The stranger is quite\r\n",
      "reasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any\r\n",
      "one else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be\r\n",
      "much better, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when\r\n",
      "you can hear him and talk to him as you will.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The man is no fool,\" answered Penelope, \"it would very likely be\r\n",
      "as he says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world\r\n",
      "as these men are.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he\r\n",
      "had explained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in\r\n",
      "his ear so that none could overhear him, \"My dear sir, I will now\r\n",
      "go back to the pigs, to see after your property and my own business.\r\n",
      "You will look to what is going on here, but above all be careful to\r\n",
      "keep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. May\r\n",
      "Jove bring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well,\" replied Telemachus, \"go home when you have had your dinner,\r\n",
      "and in the morning come here with the victims we are to sacrifice\r\n",
      "for the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his\r\n",
      "dinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table,\r\n",
      "and went back to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began\r\n",
      "to amuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting\r\n",

      "Now there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all\r\n",
      "over the city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton\r\n",
      "and drunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him, but he was\r\n",
      "a great hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his mother\r\n",
      "gave him, was Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called him Irus,\r\n",
      "because he used to run errands for any one who would send him. As\r\n",

      "to do so? Get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to blows.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses frowned on him and said, \"My friend, I do you no manner of\r\n",
      "harm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is\r\n",
      "room enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge\r\n",
      "me things that are not yours to give. You seem to be just such another\r\n",
      "tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by\r\n",

      "The stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight, let us\r\n",
      "set them on to do so at once.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged\r\n",
      "tramps. \"Listen to me,\" said Antinous, \"there are some goats' paunches\r\n",
      "down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set\r\n",
      "aside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the\r\n",
      "better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our\r\n",
      "table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent, said,\r\n",
      "\"Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold\r\n",
      "his own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on,\r\n",
      "though I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear,\r\n",
      "however that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour Irus and\r\n",
      "secure him the victory.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath\r\n",
      "Telemachus put in a word and said, \"Stranger, if you have a mind to\r\n",
      "settle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. Whoever\r\n",
      "strikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and the other\r\n",
      "chiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of understanding,\r\n",
      "are of the same mind as I am.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,\r\n",
      "thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and\r\n",
      "his mighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even\r\n",
      "stronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one\r\n",
      "would turn towards his neighbour saying, \"The stranger has brought\r\n",
      "such a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left\r\n",
      "of Irus.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Irus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded\r\n",
      "him by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court] in\r\n",
      "such a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded\r\n",
      "him and said, \"You swaggering bully, you ought never to have been\r\n",
      "born at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creature\r\n",
      "as this tramp is. I say, therefore- and it shall surely be- if he\r\n",
      "beats you and proves himself the better man, I shall pack you off\r\n",
      "on board ship to the mainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills\r\n",
      "every one that comes near him. He will cut off your nose and ears,\r\n",
      "and draw out your entrails for the dogs to eat.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the middle\r\n",
      "of the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then Ulysses\r\n",
      "considered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an\r\n",
      "end of him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter\r\n",
      "blow that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best\r\n",
      "to give the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to suspect\r\n",
      "who he was. Then they began to fight, and Irus hit Ulysses on the\r\n",
      "right shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the\r\n",
      "ear that broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came gushing\r\n",
      "out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth\r\n",
      "and kicking on the ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and\r\n",
      "nearly died of laughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him by the foot\r\n",
      "and dragged him into the outer court as far as the gate-house. There\r\n",
      "he propped him up against the wall and put his staff in his hands.\r\n",
      "\"Sit here,\" said he, \"and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful\r\n",
      "creature, and if you try to make yourself king of the beggars any\r\n",
      "more you shall fare still worse.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, over his\r\n",
      "shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down\r\n",
      "upon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing\r\n",
      "and saluting him, \"May Jove, and all the other gods,\" said they, 'grant\r\n",
      "you whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity of\r\n",
      "this insatiable tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently,\r\n",
      "to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat's\r\n",
      "paunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two loaves\r\n",
      "out of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he\r\n",
      "did so in a golden goblet of wine. \"Good luck to you,\" he said, \"father\r\n",
      "stranger, you are very badly off at present, but I hope you will have\r\n",
      "better times by and by.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this Ulysses answered, \"Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of good\r\n",
      "understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are.\r\n",
      "I have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium,\r\n",
      "a man both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you\r\n",
      "appear to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed\r\n",
      "to what I am saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have\r\n",
      "their being upon earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and\r\n",
      "strength, he thinks that he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even\r\n",
      "when the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs\r\n",
      "must, and makes the best of it; for God Almighty gives men their daily\r\n",
      "minds day by day. I know all about it, for I was a rich man once,\r\n",
      "and did much wrong in the stubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence\r\n",
      "that my father and my brothers would support me; therefore let a man\r\n",
      "fear God in all things always, and take the good that heaven may see\r\n",
      "fit to send him without vainglory. Consider the infamy of what these\r\n",
      "suitors are doing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing\r\n",
      "dishonour to the wife, of one who is certain to return some day, and\r\n",
      "that, too, not long hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may heaven send\r\n",
      "you home quietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of\r\n",
      "his coming, for once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk he\r\n",
      "put the gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walked away\r\n",
      "serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so he\r\n",
      "did not escape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him fall by the\r\n",
      "hand of Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place from which\r\n",
      "he had come. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the\r\n",
      "suitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and\r\n",
      "win still further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned\r\n",
      "a mocking laugh and said, \"Eurynome, I have changed my and have a\r\n",
      "fancy to show myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should\r\n",
      "like also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything\r\n",
      "more to do with them. They speak fairly enough but they mean mischief.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear child,\" answered Eurynome, \"all that you have said is true,\r\n",
      "go and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint\r\n",
      "your face. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears;\r\n",
      "it is not right that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus,\r\n",
      "whom you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is\r\n",
      "already grown up.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know, Eurynome,\" replied Penelope, \"that you mean well, but do\r\n",
      "not try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven robbed\r\n",
      "me of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell\r\n",
      "Autonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me when\r\n",
      "I am in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it would\r\n",
      "not be proper for me to do so.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go to\r\n",
      "their mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another matter,\r\n",
      "and sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on her\r\n",
      "couch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed\r\n",
      "grace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her.\r\n",
      "She washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears\r\n",
      "when she goes dancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of\r\n",
      "a more commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter\r\n",
      "than sawn ivory. When Minerva had done all this she went away, whereon\r\n",
      "the maids came in from the women's room and woke Penelope with the\r\n",
      "sound of their talking. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,\" said she,\r\n",
      "as she passed her hands over her face, \"in spite of all my misery.\r\n",
      "I wish Diana would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment,\r\n",
      "that I might no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband,\r\n",
      "who possessed every kind of good quality and was the most distinguished\r\n",
      "man among the Achaeans.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but\r\n",
      "attended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she\r\n",
      "stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,\r\n",
      "holding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either\r\n",
      "side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and\r\n",
      "became so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might\r\n",
      "win her for his own bed fellow. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Telemachus,\" said she, addressing her son, \"I fear you are no longer\r\n",
      "so discreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were younger\r\n",
      "you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are grown\r\n",
      "up, though a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of\r\n",
      "a well-to-do father as far as size and good looks go, your conduct\r\n",
      "is by no means what it should be. What is all this disturbance that\r\n",
      "has been going on, and how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully\r\n",
      "ill-treated? What would have happened if he had suffered serious injury\r\n",
      "while a suppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very discreditable\r\n",
      "to you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,\" replied\r\n",
      "Telemachus, \"I understand all about it and know when things are not\r\n",
      "as they should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot,\r\n",
      "however, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and\r\n",
      "then another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my\r\n",
      "mind, and I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight\r\n",
      "between Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant\r\n",
      "it to do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,\r\n",
      "Minerva, and Apollo would break the neck of every one of these wooers\r\n",
      "of yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might\r\n",
      "all be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court.\r\n",
      "See how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing\r\n",
      "that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home, wherever\r\n",
      "that may be, for has no strength left in him.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, \"Queen Penelope,\r\n",
      "daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could see\r\n",
      "you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house\r\n",
      "by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole\r\n",
      "world both as regards personal beauty and strength of understanding.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this Penelope replied, \"Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my\r\n",
      "beauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy\r\n",
      "and my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after\r\n",
      "my affairs, I should both be more respected and show a better presence\r\n",
      "to the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\r\n",
      "which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all,\r\n",
      "and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand- 'Wife,\r\n",
      "'he said, 'we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the\r\n",
      "Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. They are excellent also\r\n",
      "at fighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight\r\n",
      "sooner than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send\r\n",
      "me back to you, or whether I may not fall over there at Troy. In the\r\n",
      "meantime do you look after things here. Take care of my father and\r\n",
      "mother as at present, and even more so during my absence, but when\r\n",
      "you see our son growing a beard, then marry whom you will, and leave\r\n",
      "this your present home. This is what he said and now it is all coming\r\n",
      "true. A night will come when I shall have to yield myself to a marriage\r\n",
      "which I detest, for Jove has taken from me all hope of happiness.\r\n",
      "This further grief, moreover, cuts me to the very heart. You suitors\r\n",
      "are not wooing me after the custom of my country. When men are courting\r\n",
      "a woman who they think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble\r\n",
      "birth, and when they are each trying to win her for himself, they\r\n",
      "usually bring oxen and sheep to feast the friends of the lady, and\r\n",
      "they make her magnificent presents, instead of eating up other people's\r\n",
      "property without paying for it.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying\r\n",
      "to get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair\r\n",
      "words which he knew she did not mean. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Antinous said, \"Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as\r\n",
      "many presents as you please from any one who will give them to you;\r\n",
      "it is not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business\r\n",
      "nor stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among\r\n",
      "us whoever he may be.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his\r\n",
      "servant to bring his present. Antinous's man returned with a large\r\n",
      "and lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully\r\n",
      "made brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus\r\n",
      "immediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads\r\n",
      "that gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas's two men returned with some\r\n",
      "earrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened most\r\n",
      "beautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace\r\n",
      "of the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful\r\n",
      "present of some kind. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought\r\n",
      "the presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and\r\n",
      "dancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it\r\n",
      "grew dark; they then brought in three braziers to give light, and\r\n",
      "piled them up with chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torches\r\n",
      "from them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Ulysses\r\n",
      "said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the\r\n",
      "queen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick\r\n",
      "wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till\r\n",
      "morning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho\r\n",
      "began to gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, but\r\n",
      "had been brought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play\r\n",
      "with, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all\r\n",
      "this she showed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress,\r\n",
      "and used to misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was\r\n",
      "in love. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Poor wretch,\" said she, \"are you gone clean out of your mind? Go\r\n",
      "and sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering\r\n",
      "here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters-\r\n",
      "so many of them too? Has the wine been getting into your head, or\r\n",
      "do you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits\r\n",
      "because you beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than\r\n",
      "he does not come and cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding\r\n",
      "out of the house.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Vixen,\" replied Ulysses, scowling at her, \"I will go and tell Telemachus\r\n",
      "what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb from limb.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words he scared the women, and they went off into the body\r\n",
      "of the house. They trembled all aver, for they thought he would do\r\n",
      "as he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers,\r\n",
      "holding up torches and looking at the people- brooding the while on\r\n",
      "things that should surely come to pass. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their insolence,\r\n",
      "for she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against them; she\r\n",
      "therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him, which made\r\n",
      "the others laugh. \"Listen to me,\" said he, \"you suitors of Queen Penelope,\r\n",
      "that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for nothing that this\r\n",
      "man has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe the light has not\r\n",
      "been coming from the torches, but from his own head- for his hair\r\n",
      "is all gone, every bit of it.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then turning to Ulysses he said, \"Stranger, will you work as a servant,\r\n",
      "if I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you\r\n",
      "build a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year\r\n",
      "round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then?\r\n",
      "Not you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not want to work;\r\n",
      "you had rather fill your belly by going round the country begging.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eurymachus,\" answered Ulysses, \"if you and I were to work one against\r\n",
      "the other in early summer when the days are at their longest- give\r\n",
      "me a good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which\r\n",
      "will fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when\r\n",
      "the mowing grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us\r\n",
      "each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and\r\n",
      "endurance: turn me into a four acre field, and see whether you or\r\n",
      "I can drive the straighter furrow. If, again, war were to break out\r\n",
      "this day, give me a shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting\r\n",
      "well upon my temples- you would find me foremost in the fray, and\r\n",
      "would cease your gibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel,\r\n",
      "and think yourself a great man because you live in a little world,\r\n",
      "ind that a bad one. If Ulysses comes to his own again, the doors of\r\n",
      "his house are wide, but you will find them narrow when you try to\r\n",
      "fly through them.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Eurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, \"You\r\n",
      "wretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me,\r\n",
      "and in public too. Has the wine been getting into your head or do\r\n",
      "you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because\r\n",
      "you beat the tramp Irus. With this he caught hold of a footstool,\r\n",
      "but Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium,\r\n",
      "for he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and\r\n",

      "were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his neighbour, saying,\r\n",
      "\"I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad luck to hide, for\r\n",
      "all the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such disturbance about\r\n",

      "has possessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you\r\n",
      "have had your suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better.\"\r\n",

      "why you have removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the\r\n",
      "way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses\r\n",
      "went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this\r\n",
      "more particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel\r\n",
      "over their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may\r\n",

      "store room? The maids would have so, but you would not let them.\r\n",

      "Then Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields,\r\n",
      "and spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in\r\n",
      "her hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus\r\n",
      "said, \"Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the\r\n",
      "rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow\r\n",

      "at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away the bread\r\n",
      "that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied\r\n",
      "the embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to\r\n",
      "give both light and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a\r\n",
      "second time and said, \"Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging\r\n",

      "are all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after\r\n",

      "and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp\r\n",
      "such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I\r\n",
      "had any number of servants, and all the other things which people\r\n",

      "to take all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come\r\n",

      "dare to chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven\r\n",
      "itself; you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness,\r\n",
      "as the monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its\r\n",
      "wheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring\r\n",
      "forth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues,\r\n",
      "and his people do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here\r\n",
      "in your house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know\r\n",
      "my race and family, or you will recall memories that will yet more\r\n",
      "increase my sorrow. I am full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit\r\n",
      "weeping and wailing in another person's house, nor is it well to be\r\n",
      "thus grieving continually. I shall have one of the servants or even\r\n",

      "to the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\r\n",

      "islands- Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself,\r\n",
      "are wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore\r\n",
      "show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who\r\n",
      "say that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time brokenhearted\r\n",
      "about Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to\r\n",
      "invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven\r\n",
      "put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and\r\n",
      "to begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I\r\n",
      "said to them, 'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not\r\n",
      "press me to marry again immediately; wait- for I would not have my\r\n",

      "a pall for the hero Laertes, to be ready against the time when death\r\n",
      "shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk\r\n",
      "if he is laid out without a pall.' This was what I said, and they\r\n",
      "assented; whereon I used to keep working at my great web all day long,\r\n",
      "but at night I would unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled\r\n",
      "them in this way for three years without their finding it out, but\r\n",
      "as time wore on and I was now in my fourth year, in the waning of\r\n",
      "moons, and many days had been accomplished, those good-for-nothing\r\n",
      "hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who broke in upon me\r\n",
      "and caught me; they were very angry with me, so I was forced to finish\r\n",
      "my work whether I would or no. And now I do not see how I can find\r\n",
      "any further shift for getting out of this marriage. My parents are\r\n",
      "putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes at the ravages the\r\n",
      "suitors are making upon his estate, for he is now old enough to understand\r\n",
      "all about it and is perfectly able to look after his own affairs,\r\n",
      "for heaven has blessed him with an excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding\r\n",
      "all this, tell me who you are and where you come from- for you must\r\n",
      "have had father and mother of some sort; you cannot be the son of\r\n",
      "an oak or of a rock.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Ulysses answered, \"madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist\r\n",
      "in asking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs\r\n",
      "me: people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as\r\n",
      "long as I have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless,\r\n",
      "as regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair\r\n",
      "and fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled\r\n",
      "and there are nine cities in it: the people speak many different languages\r\n",
      "which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans,\r\n",
      "Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great town\r\n",
      "there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years had a conference\r\n",
      "with Jove himself. Minos was father to Deucalion, whose son I am,\r\n",
      "for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus sailed\r\n",
      "for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my brother,\r\n",
      "however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two; hence\r\n",
      "it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him hospitality, for\r\n",
      "the winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy, carrying him\r\n",
      "out of his course from cape Malea and leaving him in Amnisus off the\r\n",
      "cave of Ilithuia, where the harbours are difficult to enter and he\r\n",
      "could hardly find shelter from the winds that were then xaging. As\r\n",
      "soon as he got there he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus,\r\n",
      "claiming to be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already\r\n",
      "set sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier, so I took him to\r\n",
      "my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had abundance\r\n",
      "of everything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with barley\r\n",
      "meal from the public store, and got subscriptions of wine and oxen\r\n",
      "for them to sacrifice to their heart's content. They stayed with me\r\n",
      "twelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the North so strong\r\n",
      "that one could hardly keep one's feet on land. I suppose some unfriendly\r\n",
      "god had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the wind dropped,\r\n",
      "and they got away.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept\r\n",
      "as she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon\r\n",
      "the mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed\r\n",
      "upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even\r\n",
      "so did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all\r\n",
      "the time sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was for her,\r\n",
      "but he kept his eyes as hard as or iron without letting them so much\r\n",
      "as quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she\r\n",
      "had relieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said:\r\n",
      "\"Now, stranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no\r\n",
      "you really did entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did.\r\n",
      "Tell me, then, how he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look\r\n",
      "at, and so also with his companions.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Madam,\" answered Ulysses, \"it is such a long time ago that I can\r\n",
      "hardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home,\r\n",
      "and went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect.\r\n",
      "Ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened\r\n",
      "by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this\r\n",
      "there was a device that showed a dog holding a spotted fawn between\r\n",
      "his fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground.\r\n",
      "Every one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done\r\n",
      "in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the\r\n",
      "fawn was struggling convulsively to escape. As for the shirt that\r\n",
      "he wore next his skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the\r\n",
      "skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration\r\n",
      "of all the women who beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying\r\n",
      "to your heart, that I do not know whether Ulysses wore these clothes\r\n",
      "when he left home, or whether one of his companions had given them\r\n",
      "to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one at whose house\r\n",
      "he was staying made him a present of them, for he was a man of many\r\n",
      "friends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a\r\n",
      "sword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with\r\n",
      "a shirt that went down to his feet, and I sent him on board his ship\r\n",
      "with every mark of honour. He had a servant with him, a little older\r\n",
      "than himself, and I can tell you what he was like; his shoulders were\r\n",
      "hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair. His name was Eurybates,\r\n",
      "and Ulysses treated him with greater familiarity than he did any of\r\n",
      "the others, as being the most like-minded with himself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable\r\n",
      "proofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found\r\n",
      "relief in tears she said to him, \"Stranger, I was already disposed\r\n",
      "to pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome\r\n",
      "in my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I\r\n",
      "took them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and I gave\r\n",
      "him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never\r\n",
      "welcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out\r\n",
      "for that detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even\r\n",
      "to mention.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure yourself\r\n",
      "further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can hardly\r\n",
      "blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and borne\r\n",
      "him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even though\r\n",
      "he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god. Still,\r\n",
      "cease your tears and listen to what I can tell I will hide nothing\r\n",
      "from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately heard\r\n",
      "of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the Thesprotians,\r\n",
      "and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has begged from\r\n",
      "one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were lost as\r\n",
      "they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the sun-god\r\n",
      "were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the sun-god's\r\n",
      "cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck to the\r\n",
      "keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the Phaecians,\r\n",
      "who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him as though\r\n",
      "he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to escort\r\n",
      "him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here long\r\n",
      "ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth;\r\n",
      "for there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no one\r\n",
      "can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all\r\n",
      "this, and he swore to me- making drink-offerings in his house as he\r\n",
      "did so- that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who\r\n",
      "would take Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there\r\n",
      "happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island\r\n",
      "of Dulichium, but he showed me all treasure Ulysses had got together,\r\n",
      "and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family\r\n",
      "for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona\r\n",
      "that he might learn Jove's mind from the high oak tree, and know whether\r\n",
      "after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret.\r\n",
      "So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at\r\n",
      "hand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I\r\n",
      "will confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first\r\n",
      "and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses\r\n",
      "to which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come\r\n",
      "to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end\r\n",
      "of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true you\r\n",
      "shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see\r\n",
      "you shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses\r\n",
      "will not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely\r\n",
      "as that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such masters\r\n",
      "in the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further\r\n",
      "them on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him,\r\n",
      "and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may\r\n",

      "in her arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She\r\n",

      "alone from ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the\r\n",
      "women in some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at\r\n",
      "him as all these sluts here have been gibing you. I do not wonder\r\n",
      "at your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which\r\n",
      "they have insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough,\r\n",
      "as Penelope has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for\r\n",

      "turned away from the light, for it occurred to him that when the old\r\n",
      "woman had hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar which\r\n",
      "it bore, whereon the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon\r\n",
      "as she began washing her master, she at once knew the scar as one\r\n",
      "that had been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on Mount\r\n",
      "Parnassus with his excellent grandfather Autolycus- who was the most\r\n",
      "accomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world- and with the sons\r\n",
      "of Autolycus. Mercury himself had endowed him with this gift, for\r\n",
      "he used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him, so he took\r\n",
      "pleasure in his companionship. It happened once that Autolycus had\r\n",
      "gone to Ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born.\r\n",
      "As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set the infant upon his knees\r\n",
      "and said, you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wished\r\n",
      "that you might have one.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Son-in-law and daughter,\" replied Autolycus, \"call the child thus:\r\n",
      "I am highly displeased with a large number of people in one place\r\n",
      "and another, both men and women; so name the child 'Ulysses,' or the\r\n",
      "child of anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother's family\r\n",
      "on Mount Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present\r\n",
      "and will send him on his way rejoicing.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from Autolycus,\r\n",
      "who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome. His grandmother\r\n",
      "Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head, and both\r\n",
      "his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to get dinner\r\n",
      "ready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five year old\r\n",
      "bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints; these they\r\n",
      "then cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted\r\n",
      "them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus through the\r\n",
      "livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and every\r\n",
      "man had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun\r\n",
      "set and it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of\r\n",
      "sleep. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons\r\n",
      "of Autolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went\r\n",
      "too. They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached\r\n",
      "its breezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon\r\n",
      "the fields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they\r\n",
      "came to a mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the\r\n",
      "tracks of the beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons\r\n",
      "of Autolycus, among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he\r\n",
      "had a long spear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among\r\n",
      "some thick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get\r\n",
      "through it, nor could the sun's rays pierce it, and the ground underneath\r\n",
      "lay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men's\r\n",
      "feet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up\r\n",
      "to him, so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck,\r\n",
      "and stood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the\r\n",
      "first to raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the\r\n",
      "boar was too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him\r\n",
      "above the knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach\r\n",
      "the bone. As for the boar, Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder,\r\n",
      "and the point of the spear went right through him, so that he fell\r\n",
      "groaning in the dust until the life went out of him. The sons of Autolycus\r\n",
      "busied themselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses'\r\n",
      "wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went\r\n",
      "home as fast as they could. But when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly\r\n",
      "healed Ulysses, they made him some splendid presents, and sent him\r\n",
      "back to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When he got back, his father\r\n",
      "and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all about it, and\r\n",
      "how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how the boar\r\n",
      "had ripped him when he was out hunting with Autolycus and his sons\r\n",
      "on Mount Parnassus. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had\r\n",
      "well hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at once. The\r\n",
      "leg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that\r\n",
      "all the water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea's eyes between her\r\n",
      "joy and her grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but\r\n",
      "she caught Ulysses by the beard and said, \"My dear child, I am sure\r\n",
      "you must be Ulysses himself, only I did not know you till I had actually\r\n",
      "touched and handled you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell\r\n",
      "her that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable\r\n",
      "to look in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva\r\n",
      "had diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat\r\n",
      "with his right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said,\r\n",
      "\"Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your\r\n",
      "own breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last\r\n",
      "come to my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by\r\n",
      "heaven to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about\r\n",
      "it any one else in the house, for if you do I tell you- and it shall\r\n",
      "surely be- that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors,\r\n",
      "I will not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing\r\n",
      "the other women.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My child,\" answered Euryclea, \"what are you talking about? You know\r\n",
      "very well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my\r\n",
      "tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and\r\n",
      "lay my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors\r\n",
      "into your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who\r\n",
      "have been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Ulysses answered, \"Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way;\r\n",
      "I am well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold\r\n",
      "your tongue and leave everything to heaven.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,\r\n",
      "for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and\r\n",
      "anointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to\r\n",
      "warm himself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began\r\n",
      "talking to him and said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another matter.\r\n",
      "It is indeed nearly bed time- for those, at least, who can sleep in\r\n",
      "spite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such\r\n",
      "unmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my duties\r\n",
      "and looking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during\r\n",
      "the whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed,\r\n",
      "I lie awake thinking, and my heart comes a prey to the most incessant\r\n",
      "and cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus,\r\n",
      "sings in the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and\r\n",
      "with many a plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed\r\n",
      "her own child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss\r\n",
      "and turn in its uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here,\r\n",
      "and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house,\r\n",
      "out of regard to public opinion and the memory of my late husband,\r\n",
      "or whether it is not now time for me to go with the best of these\r\n",
      "suitors who are wooing me and making me such magnificent presents.\r\n",
      "As long as my son was still young, and unable to understand, he would\r\n",
      "not hear of my leaving my husband's house, but now that he is full\r\n",
      "grown he begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way in\r\n",
      "which the suitors are eating up his property. Listen, then, to a dream\r\n",
      "that I have had and interpret it for me if you can. I have twenty\r\n",
      "geese about the house that eat mash out of a trough, and of which\r\n",
      "I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great eagle came swooping\r\n",
      "down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into the neck of each\r\n",
      "of them till he had killed them all. Presently he soared off into\r\n",
      "the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard; whereon I wept in\r\n",
      "my room till all my maids gathered round me, so piteously was I grieving\r\n",
      "because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he came back again, and\r\n",
      "perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human voice, and\r\n",
      "told me to leave off crying. 'Be of good courage,' he said, 'daughter\r\n",
      "of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen that shall\r\n",
      "surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no longer\r\n",
      "an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who will\r\n",
      "bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.' On this I woke, and when\r\n",
      "I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This dream, Madam,\" replied Ulysses, \"can admit but of one interpretation,\r\n",
      "for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? The\r\n",
      "death of the suitors is portended, and not one single one of them\r\n",
      "will escape.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Penelope answered, \"Stranger, dreams are very curious and unaccountable\r\n",
      "things, and they do not by any means invariably come true. There are\r\n",
      "two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed; the one\r\n",
      "is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through the gate\r\n",
      "of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean something\r\n",
      "to those that see them. I do not think, however, that my own dream\r\n",
      "came through the gate of horn, though I and my son should be most\r\n",
      "thankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say- and lay\r\n",
      "my saying to your heart- the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened\r\n",
      "day that is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about\r\n",
      "to hold a tournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes\r\n",
      "in the court, one in front of the other, like the stays upon which\r\n",
      "a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot an arrow\r\n",
      "through the whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same\r\n",
      "thing, and whichever of them can string the bow most easily, and send\r\n",
      "his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit\r\n",
      "this house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth.\r\n",
      "But even so, I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Ulysses answered, \"Madam wife of Ulysses, you need not defer\r\n",
      "your tournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string\r\n",
      "the bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the\r\n",
      "iron.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this Penelope said, \"As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk\r\n",
      "to me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do\r\n",
      "permanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on\r\n",
      "earth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline\r\n",
      "upon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from\r\n",
      "the day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by\r\n",

      "Ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock's hide, on\r\n",
      "the top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had\r\n",
      "eaten, and Eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself\r\n",
      "down. There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in\r\n",
      "which he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who had\r\n",
      "been in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the\r\n",
      "house giggling and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very\r\n",
      "angry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every single one\r\n",
      "of them then and there, or to let them sleep one more and last time\r\n",
      "with the suitors. His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with\r\n",
      "puppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did\r\n",
      "his heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done:\r\n",
      "but he beat his breast and said, \"Heart, be still, you had worse than\r\n",
      "this to bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions;\r\n",
      "yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you safe out of the\r\n",
      "cave, though you made sure of being killed.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but\r\n",
      "he tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in\r\n",
      "front of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other,\r\n",
      "that he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn\r\n",
      "himself about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single\r\n",
      "handed as he was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men\r\n",
      "as the wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven\r\n",
      "in the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, \"My\r\n",
      "poor unhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house:\r\n",
      "your wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a\r\n",

      "I am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked\r\n",
      "suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are.\r\n",
      "And there is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable.\r\n",
      "Supposing that with Jove's and your assistance I succeed in killing\r\n",

      "wise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout\r\n",
      "in all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though there were\r\n",
      "fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you should\r\n",
      "take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you. But\r\n",

      "excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them\r\n",

      "only, and without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was.\r\n",
      "Besides, no matter how much people may grieve by day, they can put\r\n",
      "up with it so long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes are\r\n",
      "closed in slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas my misery\r\n",
      "haunts me even in my dreams. This very night methought there was one\r\n",
      "lying by my side who was like Ulysses as he was when he went away\r\n",
      "with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream,\r\n",
      "but the very truth itself.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping,\r\n",
      "and it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and\r\n",
      "was by his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on\r\n",
      "which he had lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he\r\n",
      "took the bullock's hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands\r\n",
      "to heaven, and prayed, saying \"Father Jove, since you have seen fit\r\n",
      "to bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the afflictions\r\n",
      "you have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one\r\n",
      "or other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me\r\n",
      "have another sign of some kind from outside.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high\r\n",
      "up among the from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad when\r\n",
      "he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from\r\n",
      "hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another\r\n",
      "sign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind\r\n",
      "wheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground\r\n",
      "their task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet\r\n",
      "finished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heard\r\n",
      "the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.\r\n",
      "\"Father Jove,\" said she, \"you who rule over heaven and earth, you\r\n",
      "have thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it,\r\n",
      "and this means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of\r\n",
      "me your poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very\r\n",
      "last day that the suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have\r\n",
      "worn me out with the labour of grinding meal for them, and I hope\r\n",
      "they may never have another dinner anywhere at all.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman's\r\n",
      "speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should\r\n",
      "avenge himself on the suitors. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;\r\n",
      "Telemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about\r\n",
      "his shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, and took a doughty\r\n",
      "spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold\r\n",
      "of the cloister and said to Euryclea, \"Nurse, did you make the stranger\r\n",
      "comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him shift\r\n",
      "for himself?- for my mother, good woman though she is, has a way of\r\n",
      "paying great attention to second-rate people, and of neglecting others\r\n",
      "who are in reality much better men.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do not find fault child,\" said Euryclea, \"when there is no one to\r\n",
      "find fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he\r\n",
      "liked: your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and\r\n",
      "he said he would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the servants\r\n",
      "to make one for him, but he said he was re such wretched outcast that\r\n",
      "he would not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having\r\n",
      "an undressed bullock's hide and some sheepskins put for him in the\r\n",
      "cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans\r\n",
      "were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was\r\n",
      "not alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the\r\n",
      "maids and said, \"Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and\r\n",
      "sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the\r\n",
      "seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean\r\n",
      "out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and for water from the fountain\r\n",
      "at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early,\r\n",
      "for it is a feast day.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them\r\n",
      "went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily\r\n",
      "to work about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors\r\n",
      "also came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned\r\n",
      "from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three\r\n",
      "best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises,\r\n",
      "and then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses, \"Stranger, are the suitors\r\n",
      "treating you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"May heaven,\" answered Ulysses, \"requite to them the wickedness with\r\n",
      "which they deal high-handedly in another man's house without any sense\r\n",
      "of shame.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up,\r\n",
      "for he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors' dinner;\r\n",
      "and he had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the\r\n",
      "gatehouse, and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. \"Are you still\r\n",
      "here, stranger,\" said he, \"to pester people by begging about the house?\r\n",
      "Why can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding\r\n",
      "before we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without\r\n",
      "any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the Achaeans,\r\n",
      "as well as here?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third\r\n",
      "man, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer\r\n",
      "and some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there\r\n",
      "to take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made\r\n",
      "his heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went\r\n",
      "up to the swineherd. \"Who, Swineherd,\" said he, \"is this stranger\r\n",
      "that is lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family?\r\n",
      "Where does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some\r\n",
      "great man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will- even to kings\r\n",
      "if it so pleases them \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand;\r\n",
      "\"Good day to you, father stranger,\" said he, \"you seem to be very\r\n",
      "poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father\r\n",
      "Jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children,\r\n",
      "yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat\r\n",
      "came over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for\r\n",
      "he reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about in just such rags\r\n",
      "as this man's are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is\r\n",
      "already dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master,\r\n",
      "who made me his stockman when I was quite young among the Cephallenians,\r\n",
      "and now his cattle are countless; no one could have done better with\r\n",
      "them than I have, for they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless\r\n",
      "I have to keep bringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed\r\n",
      "of his son though he is in the house, and fear not the wrath of heaven,\r\n",
      "but are already eager to divide Ulysses' property among them because\r\n",
      "he has been away so long. I have often thought- only it would not\r\n",
      "be right while his son is living- of going off with the cattle to\r\n",
      "some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still harder to\r\n",
      "stay here and be ill-treated about other people's herds. My position\r\n",
      "is intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself\r\n",
      "under the protection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor\r\n",
      "master will yet return, and send all these suitors flying out of the\r\n",
      "house.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stockman,\" answered Ulysses, \"you seem to be a very well-disposed\r\n",
      "person, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will\r\n",
      "tell you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by Jove, the chief\r\n",
      "of all gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come,\r\n",
      "Ulysses shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so\r\n",
      "minded you shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If Jove were to bring this to pass,\" replied the stockman, \"you should\r\n",
      "see how I would do my very utmost to help him.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot\r\n",
      "to murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand-\r\n",
      "an eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, \"My friends,\r\n",
      "this plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go\r\n",
      "to dinner instead.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on\r\n",
      "the benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and\r\n",
      "the heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them\r\n",
      "round. They mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd\r\n",
      "gave every man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in\r\n",
      "the breadbaskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then\r\n",
      "they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Telemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister\r\n",
      "that was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a\r\n",
      "little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought\r\n",
      "to him, with his wine in a gold cup. \"Sit there,\" said he, \"and drink\r\n",
      "your wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and\r\n",
      "blows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to\r\n",
      "Ulysses, and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your\r\n",
      "hands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be mischief.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;\r\n",
      "then Antinous said, \"We do not like such language but we will put\r\n",
      "up with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove\r\n",
      "had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the\r\n",
      "heralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the\r\n",
      "Achaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every\r\n",
      "man his portion, and feasted to their hearts' content; those who waited\r\n",
      "at table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had,\r\n",
      "for Telemachus had told them to do so. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence,\r\n",
      "for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against them. Now\r\n",
      "there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Ctesippus,\r\n",
      "and who came from Same. This man, confident in his great wealth, was\r\n",
      "paying court to the wife of Ulysses, and said to the suitors, \"Hear\r\n",
      "what I have to say. The stranger has already had as large a portion\r\n",
      "as any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor reasonable\r\n",
      "to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I will, however,\r\n",
      "make him a present on my own account, that he may have something to\r\n",
      "give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses' servants.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket in which\r\n",
      "it lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little\r\n",
      "aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion as he did\r\n",
      "so, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely\r\n",
      "to Ctesippus, \"It is a good thing for you,\" said he, \"that the stranger\r\n",
      "turned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should\r\n",
      "have run you through with my spear, and your father would have had\r\n",
      "to see about getting you buried rather than married in this house.\r\n",
      "So let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am\r\n",
      "grown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what\r\n",
      "is going on, instead of being the child that I have been heretofore.\r\n",
      "I have long seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn\r\n",
      "and wine: I have put up with this, for one man is no match for many,\r\n",
      "but do me no further violence. Still, if you wish to kill me, kill\r\n",
      "me; I would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after\r\n",
      "day- guests insulted, and men dragging the women servants about the\r\n",
      "house in an unseemly way.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,\r\n",
      "\"No one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay\r\n",
      "it, for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating\r\n",
      "the stranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house;\r\n",
      "I would say, however, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother,\r\n",
      "which I trust may commend itself to both. 'As long,' I would say,\r\n",
      "'as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home,\r\n",
      "no one could complain of your waiting and suffering the suitors to\r\n",

      "but it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore\r\n",
      "talk all this quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry\r\n",
      "the best man, and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer.\r\n",
      "Thus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and\r\n",

      "Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears,\r\n",
      "and their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this\r\n",

      "carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to\r\n",
      "get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and\r\n",
      "hung the doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door,\r\n",
      "put in the key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts\r\n",
      "that held the doors; these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing\r\n",
      "in a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where\r\n",
      "the chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by\r\n",
      "along with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow\r\n",
      "with its bow case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with\r\n",
      "it on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case,\r\n",
      "and when her tears had relieved her, she went to the cloister where\r\n",
      "the suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly\r\n",
      "arrows that were inside it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing\r\n",
      "a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her husband had\r\n",
      "won as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the\r\n",
      "bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil\r\n",
      "before her face, and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality\r\n",
      "of this house because its owner has been long absent, and without\r",
      "\r\n",
      "other pretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the\r\n",
      "prize that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow\r\n",
      "of Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and\r\n",
      "send his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow\r\n",
      "and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding\r\n",
      "in wealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my\r\n",
      "dreams.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron\r\n",
      "before the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she\r\n",
      "had bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master's\r\n",
      "bow, but Antinous scolded them. \"You country louts,\" said he, \"silly\r\n",
      "simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by\r\n",
      "crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her\r\n",
      "husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or\r\n",
      "go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors\r\n",
      "shall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find\r\n",
      "it no light matter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a\r\n",
      "man of us all who is such another as Ulysses; for I have seen him\r\n",
      "and remember him, though I was then only a child.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able\r\n",
      "to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was\r\n",
      "to be the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of\r\n",
      "Ulysses, whom he was dishonouring in his own house- egging the others\r\n",
      "on to do so also. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Telemachus spoke. \"Great heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"Jove must have\r\n",
      "robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying\r\n",
      "she will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying\r\n",
      "myself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the\r\n",
      "contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman\r\n",
      "whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet\r\n",
      "in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what\r\n",
      "need have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no\r\n",
      "excuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or\r\n",
      "no. I too will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot\r\n",
      "through the iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house\r\n",
      "with a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father won before\r\n",
      "me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from\r\n",
      "him, and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in\r\n",
      "a row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had Wade straight\r\n",
      "by line. Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone\r\n",
      "was surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though he had never\r\n",
      "seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement\r\n",
      "to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all\r\n",
      "his might to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though\r\n",
      "he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was\r\n",
      "trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses\r\n",
      "made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am\r\n",
      "too young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able\r\n",
      "to hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are\r\n",
      "stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that\r\n",
      "led into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the\r\n",
      "bow. Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous\r\n",
      "said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the\r\n",

      "wine.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest agreed, and Leiodes son of OEnops was the first to rise.\r\n",
      "He was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near\r\n",
      "the mixing-bowl. He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and\r\n",
      "was indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow\r\n",
      "and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he\r\n",
      "could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard\r\n",
      "work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors,\r\n",
      "\"My friends, I cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shall\r\n",
      "take the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better\r\n",
      "to die than to live after having missed the prize that we have so\r\n",
      "long striven for, and which has brought us so long together. Some\r\n",
      "one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marry Penelope,\r\n",
      "but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo and make bridal\r\n",
      "offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever makes\r\n",
      "her the best offer and whose lot it is to win her.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, with\r\n",
      "the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat\r\n",
      "again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him\r\n",
      "saying: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and\r\n",
      "intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this\r\n",
      "bow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot\r\n",
      "bend it yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there\r\n",
      "are others who will soon string it.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he said to Melanthius the goatherd, \"Look sharp, light a fire\r\n",
      "in the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring\r\n",
      "us also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let\r\n",
      "us warm the bow and grease it we will then make trial of it again,\r\n",
      "and bring the contest to an end.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Melanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside\r\n",
      "it. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the\r\n",
      "house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it,\r\n",
      "but they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless\r\n",
      "there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders\r\n",
      "among the suitors and much the foremost among them all. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and\r\n",
      "Ulysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the\r\n",
      "outer yard, Ulysses said to them quietly: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I\r\n",
      "am in doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What\r\n",
      "manner of men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should\r\n",
      "bring him back here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to\r\n",
      "do- to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Father Jove,\" answered the stockman, \"would indeed that you might\r\n",
      "so ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should\r\n",
      "see with what might and main I would fight for him.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return;\r\n",
      "when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses\r\n",
      "said, \"It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at\r\n",
      "last, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find\r\n",
      "that you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so,\r\n",
      "for I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you\r\n",
      "two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven\r\n",
      "shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both\r\n",
      "of you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall\r\n",
      "be to me as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I\r\n",
      "will now give you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured.\r\n",
      "See, here is the scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when I\r\n",
      "was out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they\r\n",
      "had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses,\r\n",
      "threw their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, while\r\n",
      "Ulysses kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have\r\n",
      "gone down upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and\r\n",
      "said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us,\r\n",
      "and tell those who a are within. When you go in, do so separately,\r\n",
      "not both together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards;\r\n",
      "Let this moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of\r\n",
      "them try to prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do\r\n",
      "you, therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying\r\n",
      "it about, and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment.\r\n",
      "If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house,\r\n",
      "they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they\r\n",
      "are at their work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the\r\n",
      "doors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat\r\n",
      "that he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming\r\n",
      "it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly\r\n",
      "grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I grieve for myself and\r\n",
      "for us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but\r\n",
      "I do not care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other\r\n",
      "women in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our\r\n",
      "being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot string his\r\n",
      "bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It shall not be so, Eurymachus,\" said Antinous, \"and you know it\r\n",
      "yourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who\r\n",
      "can string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side- as for\r\n",
      "the axes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come\r\n",
      "to the house and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his\r\n",
      "cups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of\r\n",
      "the bow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats to-morrow-\r\n",
      "the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty\r\n",
      "archer, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest\r\n",
      "to an end.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water\r\n",
      "over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls\r\n",
      "with wine and water and handed it round after giving every man his\r\n",
      "drink-offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk\r\n",
      "each as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as\r\n",
      "I am minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous\r\n",
      "who has just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present\r\n",
      "and leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give\r\n",
      "victory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow\r\n",
      "that I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether\r\n",
      "I still have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel\r\n",
      "and neglect have made an end of it.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the\r\n",
      "bow; Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, \"Wretched creature,\r\n",
      "you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought\r\n",
      "to think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your\r\n",
      "betters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others\r\n",
      "have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other\r\n",
      "beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves;\r\n",
      "the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all\r\n",
      "those drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion\r\n",
      "when he was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When the wine\r\n",
      "had got into his head he went mad and did ill deeds about the house\r\n",
      "of Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so\r\n",
      "they rushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged\r\n",
      "him through the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed,\r\n",
      "and bore the burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth,\r\n",
      "therefore, there was war between mankind and the centaurs, but he\r\n",
      "brought it upon himself through his own drunkenness. In like manner\r\n",
      "I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you string the bow:\r\n",
      "you will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship\r\n",
      "you off to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him:\r\n",
      "you will never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting\r\n",
      "into a quarrel with men younger than yourself.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Penelope then spoke to him. \"Antinous,\" said she, \"it is not right\r\n",
      "that you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this\r\n",
      "house. If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty\r\n",
      "bow of Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him\r\n",
      "and make me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in\r\n",
      "his mind: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would\r\n",
      "be out of all reason.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Queen Penelope,\" answered Eurymachus, \"we do not suppose that this\r\n",

      "lest some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should\r\n",
      "go gossiping about and say, 'These suitors are a feeble folk; they\r\n",
      "are paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them\r\n",
      "was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house\r\n",
      "strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.' This is what\r\n",
      "will be said, and it will be a scandal against us.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eurymachus,\" Penelope answered, \"people who persist in eating up\r\n",
      "the estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not\r\n",
      "expect others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men\r\n",
      "talk as you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built,\r\n",
      "he says moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and\r\n",
      "let us see whether he can string it or no. I say- and it shall surely\r\n",
      "be- that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will\r\n",
      "give him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off\r\n",
      "dogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals,\r\n",
      "and will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go.\" \r\n",

      "way or the other, not even though I choose to make the stranger a\r\n",
      "present of the bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go,\r\n",
      "then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your\r\n",
      "loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "he has got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike\r\n",
      "style does the old vagabond handle it.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another said, \"I hope he may be no more successful in other things\r\n",
      "than he is likely to be in stringing this bow.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung\r\n",
      "it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes\r\n",
      "the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand\r\n",
      "to prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the\r\n",
      "twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour\r\n",
      "as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly\r\n",
      "as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen\r\n",
      "that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took an arrow that was lying upon the table- for those which the\r\n",
      "Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver-\r\n",
      "he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the\r\n",
      "arrow and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When he\r\n",
      "had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes\r\n",
      "of the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through\r\n",
      "them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what\r\n",
      "I aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,\r\n",
      "and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time\r\n",
      "for the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight,\r\n",
      "and then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which\r\n",
      "are the crowning ornaments of a banquet.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded\r\n",
      "on his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father's\r\n",
      "seat. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Then Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement\r\n",
      "with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on\r\n",
      "to the ground at his feet and said, \"The mighty contest is at an end.\r\n",
      "I will now see whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another\r\n",
      "mark which no man has yet hit.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take\r\n",
      "up a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in\r\n",
      "his hands. He had no thought of death- who amongst all the revellers\r\n",
      "would think that one man, however brave, would stand alone among so\r\n",
      "many and kill him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the\r\n",
      "point went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup\r\n",
      "dropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his\r\n",
      "nostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on it,\r\n",
      "so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over\r\n",
      "on to the ground. The suitors were in an uproar when they saw that\r\n",
      "a man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of them from\r\n",
      "their seats and looked everywhere towards the walls, but there was\r\n",
      "neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily. \"Stranger,\"\r\n",
      "said they, \"you shall pay for shooting people in this way: om yi you\r\n",
      "shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you have\r\n",
      "slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour\r\n",
      "you for having killed him.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by mistake,\r\n",
      "and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every\r\n",
      "one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have\r\n",
      "wasted my substance, have forced my women servants to lie with you,\r\n",
      "and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared neither\r\n",
      "Cod nor man, and now you shall die.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round\r\n",
      "about to see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone\r\n",
      "spoke. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you are Ulysses,\" said he, \"then what you have said is just. We\r\n",
      "have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous\r\n",
      "who was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was\r\n",
      "all his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did\r\n",
      "not so much care about that; what he wanted was something quite different,\r\n",
      "and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son\r\n",
      "and to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met the\r\n",
      "death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make\r\n",
      "everything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that\r\n",
      "we have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth\r\n",
      "twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your\r\n",
      "heart is softened. Until we have done this no one can complain of\r\n",
      "your being enraged against us.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses again glared at him and said, \"Though you should give me all\r\n",
      "that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have,\r\n",
      "I will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must\r\n",
      "fight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where\r\n",
      "he is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let\r\n",
      "us then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield\r\n",
      "you from his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him\r\n",
      "from the pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town,\r\n",
      "and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides,\r\n",
      "and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly\r\n",
      "shot an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed\r\n",
      "itself in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over\r\n",
      "his table. The cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as\r\n",
      "he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and\r\n",
      "he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try\r\n",
      "and get him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him,\r\n",
      "and struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders\r\n",
      "and went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground\r\n",
      "and struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away\r\n",
      "from him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that\r\n",
      "if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up\r\n",
      "and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off at\r\n",
      "a run, and immediately was at his father's side. Then he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet\r\n",
      "for your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other\r\n",
      "armour for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Run and fetch them,\" answered Ulysses, \"while my arrows hold out,\r\n",
      "or when I am alone they may get me away from the door.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Telemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room\r\n",
      "where the armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and\r\n",
      "four brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all\r\n",
      "speed to his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and\r\n",
      "the swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places near\r\n",
      "Ulysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been\r\n",
      "shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another:\r\n",
      "when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end\r\n",
      "wall of the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick\r\n",
      "about his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought\r\n",
      "with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he\r\n",
      "grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of the pavement\r\n",
      "there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed\r\n",
      "by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by this door\r\n",
      "and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaus\r\n",
      "shouted out, \"Cannot some one go up to the trap door and tell the\r\n",
      "people what is going on? Help would come at once, and we should soon\r\n",
      "make an end of this man and his shooting.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This may not be, Agelaus,\" answered Melanthius, \"the mouth of the\r\n",
      "narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court.\r\n",
      "One brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know\r\n",
      "what I will do, I will bring you arms from the store room, for I am\r\n",
      "sure it is there that Ulysses and his son have put them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store\r\n",
      "room of Ulysses, house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many\r\n",
      "helmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give\r\n",
      "them to the suitors. Ulysses' heart began to fail him when he saw\r\n",
      "the suitors putting on their armour and brandishing their spears.\r\n",
      "He saw the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, \"Some\r\n",
      "one of the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may\r\n",
      "be Melanthius.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Telemachus answered, \"The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I\r\n",
      "left the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out\r\n",
      "than I have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one\r\n",
      "of the women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius\r\n",
      "the son of Dolius.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the\r\n",
      "store room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said\r\n",
      "to Ulysses who was beside him, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it\r\n",
      "is that scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to\r\n",
      "the store room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of\r\n",
      "him, or shall I bring him here that you may take your own revenge\r\n",
      "for all the many wrongs that he has done in your house?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses answered, \"Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check,\r\n",
      "no matter what they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius' hands\r\n",
      "and feet behind him. Throw him into the store room and make the door\r\n",
      "fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him\r\n",
      "close up to the rafters from a high bearing-post, that he may linger\r\n",
      "on in an agony.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to\r\n",
      "the store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for\r\n",
      "he was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room,\r\n",
      "so the two took their stand on either side of the door and waited.\r\n",
      "By and by Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old\r\n",
      "dry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when\r\n",
      "he was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the\r\n",
      "straps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him\r\n",
      "back by the hair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent\r\n",
      "his hands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with\r\n",
      "a painful bond as Ulysses had told them; then they fastened a noose\r\n",
      "about his body and strung him up from a high pillar till he was close\r\n",
      "up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaeus,\r\n",
      "saying, \"Melanthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as you\r\n",
      "deserve. You will know very well when morning comes from the streams\r\n",
      "of Oceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for\r\n",
      "the suitors to feast on.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on\r\n",
      "their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take\r\n",
      "their places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in\r\n",
      "the cloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were\r\n",
      "in the body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove's\r\n",
      "daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form\r\n",
      "of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, \"Mentor, lend\r\n",
      "me your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns\r\n",
      "he has done you. Besides, you are my age-mate.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from\r\n",
      "the other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the\r\n",
      "first to reproach her. \"Mentor,\" he cried, \"do not let Ulysses beguile\r\n",
      "you into siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we\r\n",
      "will do: when we have killed these people, father and son, we will\r\n",
      "kill you too. You shall pay for it with your head, and when we have\r\n",
      "killed you, we will take all you have, in doors or out, and bring\r\n",
      "it into hotch-pot with Ulysses' property; we will not let your sons\r\n",
      "live in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue\r\n",
      "to live in the city of Ithaca.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very\r\n",
      "angrily. \"Ulysses,\" said she, \"your strength and prowess are no longer\r\n",
      "what they were when you fought for nine long years among the Trojans\r\n",
      "about the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those days, and\r\n",
      "it was through your stratagem that Priam's city was taken. How comes\r\n",
      "it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your\r\n",
      "own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house? Come\r\n",
      "on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alcinous\r\n",
      "shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still\r\n",
      "further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she\r\n",
      "flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat\r\n",
      "upon it in the form of a swallow. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,\r\n",
      "Pisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight\r\n",
      "upon the suitors' side; of all those who were still fighting for their\r\n",
      "lives they were by far the most valiant, for the others had already\r\n",
      "fallen under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said,\r\n",
      "\"My friends, he will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away\r\n",
      "after having done nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the\r\n",
      "doors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw\r\n",
      "your spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory\r\n",
      "by killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the\r\n",
      "others.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all\r\n",
      "of no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door;\r\n",
      "the pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they\r\n",
      "had avoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own\r\n",
      "men, \"My friends, I should say we too had better let drive into the\r\n",
      "middle of them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us\r\n",
      "by us outright.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.\r\n",
      "Ulysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus,\r\n",
      "while the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as\r\n",
      "the others drew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward\r\n",
      "and regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their\r\n",
      "weapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of\r\n",
      "the cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft\r\n",
      "of another struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of\r\n",
      "the top skin from off Telemachus's wrist, and Ctesippus managed to\r\n",
      "graze Eumaeus's shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and\r\n",
      "fell to the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd\r\n",
      "of suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus\r\n",
      "Polybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and\r\n",
      "taunted him saying, \"Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so\r\n",
      "foolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your\r\n",
      "speech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present\r\n",
      "of this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when\r\n",
      "he was begging about in his own house.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with\r\n",
      "a spear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor\r\n",
      "in the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell\r\n",
      "forward full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat\r\n",
      "on the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors\r\n",
      "quailed. They fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle\r\n",
      "maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their\r\n",
      "longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains\r\n",
      "swoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground,\r\n",
      "and kill them, for they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on\r\n",
      "enjoy the sport- even so did Ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors\r\n",
      "and smite them on every side. They made a horrible groaning as their\r\n",
      "brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Leiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, \"Ulysses I beseech\r\n",
      "you have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women\r\n",
      "in your house either in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others.\r\n",
      "I saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for\r\n",
      "their folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall\r\n",
      "die without having done anything to deserve it, and shall have got\r\n",
      "no thanks for all the good that I did.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses looked sternly at him and answered, \"If you were their sacrificing\r\n",
      "priest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be long before\r\n",
      "I got home again, and that you might marry my wife and have children\r\n",
      "by her. Therefore you shall die.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when\r\n",
      "he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he\r\n",
      "struck Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling\r\n",
      "in the dust while he was yet speaking. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The minstrel Phemius son of Terpes- he who had been forced by the\r\n",
      "suitors to sing to them- now tried to save his life. He was standing\r\n",
      "near towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. He did\r\n",
      "not know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar\r\n",
      "of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and\r\n",
      "Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to\r\n",
      "go straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he\r\n",
      "deemed it best to embrace Ulysses' knees. So he laid his lyre on the\r\n",
      "ground the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded seat;\r\n",
      "then going up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, \"Ulysses,\r\n",

      "it afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both for gods and men\r\n",
      "as I can. I make all my lays myself, and heaven visits me with every\r\n",
      "kind of inspiration. I would sing to you as though you were a god,\r\n",
      "do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Your own son\r\n",
      "Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent your house\r\n",
      "and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many\r\n",
      "and too strong for me, so they made me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Telemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. \"Hold!\" he\r\n",
      "cried, \"the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will Medon too,\r\n",
      "who was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or Eumaeus\r\n",
      "has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you were\r\n",
      "raging about the court.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Medon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under\r\n",
      "a seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly\r\n",
      "flayed heifer's hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus,\r\n",
      "and laid hold of his knees. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here I am, my dear sir,\" said he, \"stay your hand therefore, and\r\n",
      "tell your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors\r\n",

      "to yourself.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses smiled at him and answered, \"Fear not; Telemachus has saved\r\n",
      "your life, that you may know in future, and tell other people, how\r\n",
      "greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside\r\n",
      "the cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way of the slaughter-\r\n",
      "you and the bard- while I finish my work here inside.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat\r\n",
      "down by Jove's great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting\r\n",
      "that they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully\r\n",
      "over, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living,\r\n",
      "but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their blood.\r\n",
      "They were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea,\r\n",
      "and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the heat of\r\n",
      "the sun makes an end of them. Even so were the suitors lying all huddled\r\n",
      "up one against the other. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Ulysses said to Telemachus, \"Call nurse Euryclea; I have something\r\n",
      "to say to her.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room. \"Make\r\n",
      "haste,\" said he, \"you old woman who have been set over all the other\r\n",
      "women in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women's room\r\n",
      "and came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses\r\n",
      "bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring\r\n",
      "an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so that\r\n",
      "he is a fearful sight; even so was Ulysses besmirched from head to\r\n",
      "foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of\r\n",
      "blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw that a great\r\n",
      "deed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, \"Old woman,\" said he,\r\n",
      "\"rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise\r\n",
      "about it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven's doom\r\n",
      "and their own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction, for\r\n",
      "they respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who\r\n",
      "came near them, and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for\r\n",
      "their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women\r\n",
      "in the house have misconducted themselves, and who are innocent.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" answered Euryclea. \"There are\r\n",
      "fifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding\r\n",
      "wool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all have\r\n",
      "misbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope.\r\n",
      "They showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only lately grown\r\n",
      "and his mother never permitted him to give orders to the female servants;\r\n",
      "but let me go upstairs and tell your wife all that has happened, for\r\n",
      "some god has been sending her to sleep.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do not wake her yet,\" answered Ulysses, \"but tell the women who have\r\n",
      "misconducted themselves to come to me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Euryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to\r\n",
      "Ulysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the\r\n",
      "swineherd. \"Begin,\" said he, \"to remove the dead, and make the women\r\n",
      "help you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables\r\n",
      "and seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters,\r\n",
      "take the women into the space between the domed room and the wall\r\n",
      "of the outer court, and run them through with your swords till they\r\n",
      "are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in which\r\n",
      "they used to lie in secret with the suitors.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.\r\n",
      "First they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against\r\n",
      "one another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made\r\n",
      "them do their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When\r\n",
      "they had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges\r\n",
      "and water, while Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood\r\n",
      "and dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all away and put\r\n",
      "it out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite clean\r\n",
      "and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow\r\n",
      "space between the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so\r\n",
      "that they could not get away: and Telemachus said to the other two,\r\n",
      "\"I shall not let these women die a clean death, for they were insolent\r\n",
      "to me and my mother, and used to sleep with the suitors.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of the bearing-posts\r\n",
      "that supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around\r\n",
      "the building, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet should\r\n",
      "touch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that\r\n",
      "has been set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their\r\n",
      "nest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have\r\n",
      "to put their heads in nooses one after the other and die most miserably.\r\n",
      "Their feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner\r\n",
      "court. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his\r\n",
      "vitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they\r\n",
      "cut off his hands and his feet. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went\r\n",
      "back into the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the\r\n",
      "dear old nurse Euryclea, \"Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution,\r\n",
      "and fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters.\r\n",
      "Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants,\r\n",
      "and also all the maid servants that are in the house.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All that you have said is true,\" answered Euryclea, \"but let me bring\r\n",
      "you some clean clothes- a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags\r\n",
      "on your back any longer. It is not right.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"First light me a fire,\" replied Ulysses. \r\n",
      "She brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses\r\n",
      "thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts.\r\n",
      "Then she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened;\r\n",
      "whereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands,\r\n",
      "and pressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing his head and shoulders\r\n",
      "and taking hold of his hands. It made him feel as if he should like\r\n",
      "to weep, for he remembered every one of them. \r\n",

      "her feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent\r\n",
      "over her head to speak to her. \"Wake up Penelope, my dear child,\"\r\n",
      "she exclaimed, \"and see with your own eyes something that you have\r\n",

      "in his house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his son.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "you; for you always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you\r\n",

      "and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of\r\n",
      "my eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from the day\r\n",
      "my poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back\r\n",
      "again into the women's room; if it had been any one else, who had\r\n",

      "with a severe scolding. As it is, your age shall protect you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear child,\" answered Euryclea, \"I am not mocking you. It is quite\r\n",

      "come home- more particularly myself, and the son who has been born\r\n",
      "to both of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some\r\n",

      "neither rich nor poor, who came near them, who came near them, and\r\n",
      "they have come to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity. Ulysses\r\n",

      "you were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband\r\n",
      "is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side\r\n",
      "at this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I\r\n",

      "one going along the street happens to notice it, they may think there\r\n",

      "and put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took\r\n",
      "his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance.\r\n",
      "The house re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the\r\n",
      "people outside said, \"I suppose the queen has been getting married\r\n",
      "at last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to\r\n",
      "protect her husband's property until he comes home.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had\r\n",

      "in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made\r\n",
      "him look taller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow\r\n",
      "thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth\r\n",
      "blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a\r\n",
      "skilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva-\r\n",
      "and his work is full of beauty- enriches a piece of silver plate by\r\n",
      "gilding it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals,\r\n",
      "and sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. \"My dear,\"\r\n",

      "god came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living, however\r\n",
      "strong and in his prime, who could move it from its place, for it\r\n",

      "was a young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full\r\n",
      "vigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round\r\n",

      "the doors strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of\r\n",
      "the olive tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly\r\n",
      "from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter's tools well\r\n",
      "and skilfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood,\r\n",
      "and making it into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle,\r\n",
      "and made it the centre-post of my bed, at which I worked till I had\r\n",
      "finished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched\r\n",
      "a hide of crimson leather from one side of it to the other. So you\r\n",
      "see I know all about it, and I desire to learn whether it is still\r\n",
      "there, or whether any one has been removing it by cutting down the\r\n",
      "olive tree at its roots.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke\r\n",
      "down. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck,\r\n",
      "and kissed him. \"Do not be angry with me Ulysses,\" she cried, \"you,\r\n",
      "who are the wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven\r\n",
      "has denied us the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing\r\n",
      "old, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did\r\n",
      "not embrace you thus as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering\r\n",
      "all the time through fear that someone might come here and deceive\r\n",
      "me with a lying story; for there are many very wicked people going\r\n",
      "about. Jove's daughter Helen would never have yielded herself to a\r\n",
      "man from a foreign country, if she had known that the sons of Achaeans\r\n",
      "would come after her and bring her back. Heaven put it in her heart\r\n",
      "to do wrong, and she gave no thought to that sin, which has been the\r\n",
      "source of all our sorrows. Now, however, that you have convinced me\r\n",
      "by showing that you know all about our bed (which no human being has\r\n",
      "ever seen but you and I and a single maid servant, the daughter of\r\n",
      "Actor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who keeps\r\n",
      "the doors of our room) hard of belief though I have been I can mistrust\r\n",
      "no longer.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and\r\n",
      "faithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men\r\n",
      "who are swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their\r\n",
      "ship with the fury of his winds and waves- a few alone reach the land,\r\n",
      "and these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves\r\n",
      "on firm ground and out of danger- even so was her husband welcome\r",
      "\r\n",
      "to her as she looked upon him, and she could not tear her two fair\r\n",
      "arms from about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging\r\n",
      "their sorrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined\r\n",
      "otherwise, and held night back in the far west, while she would not\r\n",

      "It is long and difficult, but I must go through with it, for thus\r\n",
      "the shade of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I\r\n",
      "went down into Hades to ask about my return and that of my companions.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You shall go to bed as soon as you please,\" replied Penelope, \"now\r\n",

      "country. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, tell\r\n",
      "me about the task that lies before you. I shall have to hear about\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear,\" answered Ulysses, \"why should you press me to tell you?\r\n",
      "Still, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it.\r\n",
      "I do not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide,\r\n",
      "carrying an oar, till I came to a country where the people have never\r\n",
      "heard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food. They know\r\n",
      "nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He\r\n",
      "gave me this certain token which I will not hide from you. He said\r\n",
      "that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing\r\n",
      "shovel that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my oar in\r\n",
      "the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune; after\r\n",
      "which I was to go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven,\r\n",
      "one after the other. As for myself, he said that death should come\r\n",
      "to me from the sea, and that my life should ebb away very gently when\r\n",
      "I was full of years and peace of mind, and my people should bless\r\n",
      "me. All this, he said, should surely come to pass.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Penelope said, \"If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier\r\n",

      "the bed chamber woman Eurynome to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed\r\n",
      "by torch light. When she had conducted them to their room she went\r\n",
      "back, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.\r\n",
      "Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and\r\n",
      "made the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking\r\n",
      "with one another. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing\r\n",
      "the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so\r\n",
      "many sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many casks of\r\n",
      "wine. Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much\r\n",
      "trouble he had himself given to other people. He told her everything,\r\n",
      "and she was so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till\r\n",
      "he had ended his whole story. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached\r\n",
      "the fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops\r\n",
      "and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave\r\n",
      "comrades; how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably\r\n",
      "and furthered him on his way, but even so he was not to reach home,\r\n",
      "for to his great grief a hurricane carried him out to sea again; how\r\n",
      "he went on to the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed\r\n",
      "all his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only.\r\n",
      "Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed to\r\n",
      "the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet\r\n",
      "Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother\r\n",
      "who bore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard\r\n",
      "the wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks\r\n",
      "and terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed\r\n",
      "in safety; how his men then ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how\r\n",
      "Jove therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, so that all\r\n",
      "his men perished together, himself alone being left alive; how at\r\n",
      "last he reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso, who kept\r\n",
      "him there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to marry her, in\r\n",
      "which case she intended making him immortal so that he should never\r\n",
      "grow old, but she could not persuade him to let her do so; and how\r\n",
      "after much suffering he had found his way to the Phaeacians, who had\r\n",
      "treated him as though he had been a god, and sent him back in a ship\r\n",
      "to his own country after having given him gold, bronze, and raiment\r\n",
      "in great abundance. This was the last thing about which he told her,\r\n",
      "for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden of his\r\n",
      "sorrows. \r\n",

      "this, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope,\r\n",
      "\"Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here,\r\n",
      "in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home\r\n",
      "though I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however, that we\r\n",
      "have at last come together, take care of the property that is in the\r\n",
      "house. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten,\r\n",
      "I will take many myself by force from other people, and will compel\r\n",
      "the Achaeans to make good the rest till they shall have filled all\r\n",
      "my yards. I am now going to the wooded lands out in the country to\r\n",
      "see my father who has so long been grieved on my account, and to yourself\r\n",
      "I will give these instructions, though you have little need of them.\r\n",
      "At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have been killing the\r\n",
      "suitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there with your women. See\r\n",
      "nobody and ask no questions.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus, Philoetius,\r\n",
      "and Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also. This they\r\n",
      "did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they opened the\r\n",

      "his hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men's eyes\r\n",
      "in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the\r\n",

      "one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even\r\n",
      "so did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow\r\n",
      "led them down into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the\r\n",
      "waters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the gates of the\r\n",
      "sun and the land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel\r\n",
      "where dwell the souls and shadows of them that can labour no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of\r\n",
      "Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest\r\n",
      "man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost\r\n",
      "of Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered\r\n",
      "also the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of\r\n",
      "Aeisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Son of Atreus,\" it said, \"we used to say that Jove had loved you\r\n",
      "better from first to last than any other hero, for you were captain\r\n",
      "over many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before\r\n",
      "Troy; yet the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid\r\n",
      "upon you all too early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the\r\n",
      "hey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound\r\n",
      "over your ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good name,\r\n",
      "whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Happy son of Peleus,\" answered the ghost of Agamemnon, \"for having\r\n",
      "died at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and\r\n",
      "the Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay\r\n",
      "in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now\r\n",
      "of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should\r\n",
      "we ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us.\r\n",
      "Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid\r\n",
      "you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with\r\n",
      "ointments. The Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about\r\n",
      "you. Your mother, when she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from\r\n",
      "out of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing went forth over the\r\n",
      "waters so that the Achaeans quaked for fear. They would have fled\r\n",

      "nymphs to view the body of her son.' \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of\r\n",
      "the old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed\r\n",
      "you in immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their\r\n",
      "sweet voices in lament- calling and answering one another; there was\r\n",
      "not an Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and\r\n",
      "nights seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on\r\n",
      "the eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep\r\n",
      "with many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt\r\n",
      "in raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,\r\n",
      "horse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were burning,\r\n",
      "with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven\r\n",
      "had done their work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and\r\n",
      "laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a\r\n",
      "golden vase to hold them- gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself;\r\n",
      "in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroclus who\r\n",
      "had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those of Antilochus,\r\n",
      "who had been closer to you than any other of your comrades now that\r\n",

      "out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born\r\n",
      "hereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them\r\n",
      "to be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have\r\n",
      "been present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird\r\n",
      "themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some\r\n",
      "great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\r\n",
      "offered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in\r\n",
      "death your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives\r\n",
      "evermore among all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when\r\n",
      "the days of my fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction\r\n",
      "on my return, by the hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with\r\n",
      "the ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts\r\n",

      "up to them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon son\r\n",

      "all of an age too- that you are come down here under the ground? One\r\n",
      "could pick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his\r\n",
      "winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies\r\n",
      "make an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or\r\n",
      "sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of their wives and city?\r\n",
      "Answer my question, for I have been your guest. Do you not remember\r\n",
      "how I came to your house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to join\r\n",
      "us with his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could\r\n",
      "resume our voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come\r\n",
      "with us.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the ghost of Amphimedon answered, \"Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king\r\n",
      "of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you\r\n",
      "fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.\r\n",
      "Ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did\r\n",
      "not say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters\r\n",
      "to an end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this, then, was\r\n",
      "the trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room\r\n",
      "and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'Sweethearts,'\r\n",
      "said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry\r\n",
      "again immediately; wait- for I would not have my skill in needlework\r\n",
      "perish unrecorded- till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes,\r\n",
      "against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the\r\n",
      "women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' This\r\n",
      "is what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working\r\n",
      "upon her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the\r\n",
      "stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three\r\n",
      "years without our finding it out, but as time wore on and she was\r\n",
      "now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many days had been\r\n",
      "accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us,\r\n",
      "and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish\r\n",
      "it whether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had\r\n",
      "made, after she had had it washed, its splendour was as that of the\r\n",
      "sun or moon. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where\r\n",
      "his swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning\r\n",
      "from a voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had\r\n",
      "hatched their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and\r\n",
      "then after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in\r\n",
      "rags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar.\r\n",
      "He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older\r\n",
      "ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured\r\n",
      "both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his\r\n",
      "own house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he\r\n",
      "and Telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting\r\n",
      "the doors behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow\r\n",
      "and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors;\r\n",
      "and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string\r\n",
      "the bow- nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the hands of\r\n",
      "Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him,\r\n",
      "no matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having\r\n",
      "it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent\r\n",
      "his arrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister\r\n",
      "and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First\r\n",
      "he killed Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly\r\n",
      "his deadly darts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain\r\n",
      "that some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us\r\n",
      "with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous\r\n",
      "sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the ground\r\n",
      "seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end,\r\n",
      "and our bodies are lying still un-cared for in the house of Ulysses,\r\n",
      "for our friends at home do not yet know what has happened, so that\r\n",
      "they cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from our wounds, making\r\n",
      "moan over us according to the offices due to the departed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,\" replied the ghost of Agamemnon, \"you\r\n",
      "are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare\r\n",
      "excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as\r\n",
      "Penelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue\r\n",
      "shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall\r\n",
      "be welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope.\r\n",
      "How far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus\r\n",
      "who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men,\r\n",
      "for she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the\r\n",
      "bowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of\r\n",
      "the town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes,\r\n",
      "which he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with\r\n",
      "a lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked for him\r\n",
      "slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel\r\n",
      "woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses\r\n",
      "got there, he said to his son and to the other two: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to\r\n",
      "recognize me after so long an absence.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius,\r\n",
      "who went straight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard\r\n",
      "to make trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard,\r\n",
      "he did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen,\r\n",
      "for they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard,\r\n",
      "at the place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his\r\n",
      "father alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched\r\n",
      "and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to\r\n",
      "save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he\r\n",
      "had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone.\r\n",
      "When Ulysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood\r\n",
      "still under a tall pear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether\r\n",
      "to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having come home,\r\n",
      "or whether he should first question him and see what he would say.\r\n",
      "In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so in this mind\r\n",
      "he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging about a\r\n",
      "plant. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see, sir,\" said Ulysses, \"that you are an excellent gardener- what\r\n",
      "pains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not\r\n",
      "a fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace\r\n",
      "of your attention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended\r\n",
      "if I say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself.\r\n",
      "You are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because\r\n",
      "you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you, indeed\r\n",
      "your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim\r\n",
      "you of noble birth. I should have said that you were one of those\r\n",
      "who should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have\r\n",
      "a right to do; but tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you,\r\n",
      "and in whose garden are you working? Tell me also about another matter.\r\n",
      "Is this place that I have come to really Ithaca? I met a man just\r\n",
      "now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience\r\n",
      "to hear my story out when I was asking him about an old friend of\r\n",
      "mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the\r\n",
      "house of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my\r\n",
      "house once when I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger\r\n",
      "come to me whom I liked better. He said that his family came from\r\n",
      "Ithaca and that his father was Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received\r\n",
      "him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance of my house,\r\n",
      "and when he went away I gave him all customary presents. I gave him\r\n",
      "seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with flowers\r",
      "\r\n",
      "chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces\r\n",
      "of tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve\r\n",
      "rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. To all this\r\n",
      "I added four good looking women skilled in all useful arts, and I\r\n",
      "let him take his choice.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His father shed tears and answered, \"Sir, you have indeed come to\r\n",
      "the country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of\r\n",
      "wicked people. All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose.\r\n",
      "If you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would\r\n",
      "have entertained you hospitably and would have required your presents\r\n",
      "amply when you left him- as would have been only right considering\r\n",
      "what you have already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how\r\n",
      "many years is it since you entertained this guest- my unhappy son,\r\n",
      "as ever was? Alas! He has perished far from his own country; the fishes\r\n",
      "of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and\r\n",
      "wild beasts of some continent. Neither his mother, nor I his father,\r\n",
      "who were his parents, could throw our arms about him and wrap him\r\n",
      "in his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope\r\n",
      "bewail her husband as was natural upon his death bed, and close his\r\n",
      "eyes according to the offices due to the departed. But now, tell me\r\n",
      "truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you- tell me of your\r\n",
      "town and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you and\r\n",
      "your men to Ithaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man's ship,\r\n",
      "and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will tell you everything,\" answered Ulysses, \"quite truly. I come\r\n",
      "from Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas,\r\n",
      "who is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove\r\n",
      "me off my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried\r\n",
      "here against my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off\r\n",
      "the open country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since\r\n",
      "Ulysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for\r\n",
      "him when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both\r\n",
      "he and I rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope\r\n",
      "that we should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled\r\n",
      "both hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his\r\n",
      "grey head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was\r\n",
      "touched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then\r\n",
      "he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying,\r\n",
      "\"I am he, father, about whom you are asking- I have returned after\r\n",
      "having been away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation-\r\n",
      "we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing\r\n",
      "the suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you really are my son Ulysses,\" replied Laertes, \"and have come\r\n",
      "back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity\r\n",
      "as shall convince me.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"First observe this scar,\" answered Ulysses, \"which I got from a boar's\r\n",
      "tusk when I was hunting on Mount Parnassus. You and my mother had\r\n",
      "sent me to Autolycus, my mother's father, to receive the presents\r\n",
      "which when he was over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore\r\n",
      "I will point out to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me,\r\n",
      "and I asked you all about them as I followed you round the garden.\r\n",
      "We went over them all, and you told me their names and what they all\r\n",
      "were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty\r\n",
      "fig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there\r\n",
      "was corn planted between each row, and they yield grapes of every\r\n",
      "kind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavy upon them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Laertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which\r\n",
      "his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had\r\n",
      "to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon\r\n",
      "as he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, \"O\r\n",
      "father Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the\r\n",
      "suitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless,\r\n",
      "I am much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up\r\n",
      "here directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout\r\n",
      "the cities of the Cephallenians.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ulysses answered, \"Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that,\r\n",
      "but let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told\r\n",
      "Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner\r\n",
      "ready as soon as possible.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they\r\n",
      "got there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd\r\n",
      "cutting up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman\r\n",
      "took Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She\r\n",
      "put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and gave him a\r\n",
      "more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter than before.\r\n",
      "When he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like\r\n",
      "an immortal, and said to him, \"My dear father, some one of the gods\r\n",
      "has been making you much taller and better-looking.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Laertes answered, \"Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that\r\n",
      "I were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took\r\n",
      "Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what\r\n",
      "I then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on,\r\n",
      "I should have been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors.\r\n",
      "I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced\r\n",
      "to see it.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their\r\n",
      "work and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his\r\n",
      "proper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by\r\n",
      "and by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their\r\n",
      "mother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was growing\r\n",
      "old, had been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were certain\r\n",
      "it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses scolded\r\n",
      "them good-naturedly and said, \"Sit down to your dinner, old man, and\r\n",
      "never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for\r\n",
      "some time and have been waiting for you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. \"Sir,\"\r\n",
      "said he, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, \"we\r\n",
      "have long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to\r\n",
      "us after we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the\r\n",
      "gods prosper you. But tell me, does Penelope already know of your\r\n",
      "return, or shall we send some one to tell her?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Old man,\" answered Ulysses, \"she knows already, so you need not trouble\r\n",
      "about that.\" On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered\r\n",
      "round Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after the other;\r\n",
      "then they took their seats in due order near Dolius their father.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went\r\n",
      "round the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen\r\n",
      "the suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered\r\n",
      "from every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses.\r\n",
      "They took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies\r\n",
      "of those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for\r\n",
      "the fishermen to take each of them to his own place. They then met\r\n",
      "angrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got together\r\n",
      "Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death\r\n",
      "of his son Antinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses,\r\n",
      "so he said, weeping bitterly, \"My friend, this man has done the Achaeans\r\n",
      "great wrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet,\r\n",
      "and he has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he\r\n",
      "has been killing all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let\r\n",
      "us be up and doing before he can get away to Pylos or to Elis where\r\n",
      "the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards.\r\n",
      "It will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder\r\n",
      "of our sons and brothers. For my own part I should have no mote pleasure\r\n",
      "in life, but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after\r\n",
      "them, before they can cross over to the mainland.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard\r\n",
      "Phemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses.\r\n",
      "Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle\r\n",
      "of the assembly, and Medon said, \"Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses\r\n",
      "did not do these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an\r\n",
      "immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god\r\n",
      "appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously\r\n",
      "about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick\r\n",
      "on one another.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor,\r\n",
      "rose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past\r\n",
      "and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out\r\n",
      "as they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when\r\n",
      "we bade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong\r\n",
      "in the wantonness of their hearts- wasting the substance and dishonouring\r\n",
      "the wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however,\r\n",
      "let it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against Ulysses,\r\n",
      "or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your own heads.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and\r\n",
      "at once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for\r\n",
      "the speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes;\r\n",
      "they therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed\r\n",
      "themselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes\r\n",
      "led them on in their folly. He thought he was going to avenge the\r\n",
      "murder of his son, whereas in truth he was never to return, but was\r\n",
      "himself to perish in his attempt. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Minerva said to Jove, \"Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,\r\n",
      "answer me this question- What do you propose to do? Will you set them\r\n",
      "fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Jove answered, \"My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by\r\n",
      "your own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon\r\n",
      "the suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think\r\n",
      "will be most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged,\r\n",
      "let them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue\r\n",
      "to rule, while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre\r\n",
      "of their sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as heretofore,\r\n",
      "and let peace and plenty reign.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she\r\n",
      "darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by\r\n",
      "saying, \"Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close\r\n",
      "up to us.\" So one of Dolius's sons went as he was bid. Standing on\r\n",
      "the threshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses,\r\n",
      "\"Here they are, let us put on our armour at once.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They put on their armour as fast as they could- that is to say Ulysses,\r\n",
      "his three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius\r\n",
      "did the same- warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When\r\n",
      "they had all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied\r\n",
      "forth, Ulysses leading the way. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Jove's daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form\r\n",
      "and voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to\r\n",
      "his son Telemachus, \"Telemachus, now that are about to fight in an\r\n",
      "engagement, which will show every man's mettle, be sure not to disgrace\r\n",
      "your ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and courage all\r\n",
      "the world over.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You say truly, my dear father,\" answered Telemachus, \"and you shall\r\n",
      "see, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Laertes was delighted when he heard this. \"Good heavens, he exclaimed,\r\n",
      "\"what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and grandson\r\n",
      "are vying with one another in the matter of valour.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this Minerva came close up to him and said, \"Son of Arceisius-\r\n",
      "best friend I have in the world- pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and\r\n",
      "to Jove her father; then poise your spear and hurl it.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed\r\n",
      "to her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes' helmet,\r\n",
      "and the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not,\r\n",
      "and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\r\n",
      "Meantime Ulysses and his son fell the front line of the foe and smote\r\n",
      "them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed\r\n",
      "every one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again,\r\n",
      "only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. \"Men\r\n",
      "of Ithaca,\" she cried, cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter\r\n",
      "at once without further bloodshed.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their\r\n",
      "arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound\r\n",
      "of the goddess's voice, and they fled back to the city for their lives.\r\n",
      "But Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped\r\n",
      "down like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt\r\n",
      "of fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to Ulysses,\r\n",
      "\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will\r\n",
      "be angry with you.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed\r\n",
      "the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace\r\n",
      "between the two contending parties. \r\n",
